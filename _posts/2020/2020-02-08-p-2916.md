Hey, wanna see a music video that I directed, shot, and edited? Well, here you go:

The song is “It’s OK” by [Half Zen](https://halfzenband.com/). Their first CD, “Wesoterica” (I have no idea what the title means) is going to be released later in February. The front man is a long time friend of mine from playing D&D in the 90s, and he started writing music a few years ago, then put together a band and recorded an album. Once he had the tracks recorded, he asked me to create a music video.

“But I have no experience with music videos, and essentially stopped videography and filmmaking a few years ago,” I said to Gresch. He wanted me to try anyhow, and there’s the result.
