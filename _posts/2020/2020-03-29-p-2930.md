Here is one of my birthday gifts to myself. I found it in an art gallery before the stay-at-home order went into effect, hand made by a steampunk artist named Carl Cone in Aurora. It’s a blank journal type book with homemade papyrus, but the cover is what sets it apart. He even threw in the stand for free and delivered it to my condo.


Now to fill it with mad drawings and notes for my Cthulhu themed Dungeon Crawl Classics campaign…
