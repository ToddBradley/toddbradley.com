One nice thing about being out of work is I have lots more time to experiment in the kitchen. A few days ago I made “[two-ingredient dough](https://www.weightwatchers.com/us/blog/food/two-ingredient-dough)” for the first time. I made two batches, enough to make homemade bagels one day, with lots left over for another day. Today was that other day, and I decided to try some sort of somewhat low calorie dessert.

I’m doing WW right now, formerly called Weight Watchers, to lose some weight, and didn’t want a dessert that would blow my responsible eating out of the water for the day.

Going through a bunch of options in my mind, I decided to make a sort of pastry with a thick dark chocolate filling. I’m now calling it a chocolate pizza.

I rolled the dough out and then made a little lip around the edges, thinking that would help keep the chocolate topping contained (I was wrong, and it was irrelevant).

The crust being formed
Then I beat an egg and brushed it on the dough to make it look nice and shiny. Then I put that in the oven at 425.

Meanwhile, for the topping, I put the following into my food processor and mixed it all into a wonderful paste the consistency of mousse, and the flavor of dark chocolate.

- 2 bananas, previously frozen, now thawed in the microwave
- 1/4 cup [cacao powder](https://navitasorganics.com/products/cacao-powder) (not cocoa)
- 1/4 cup pecan pieces
- 1 Tbsp chia seeds
- 1 Tbsp vanilla
- 1 tsp cinnamon

The filling/topping
After a while (15+ minutes), the crust started to brown and I thought it looked like it was ready. Baking made the crust poof up, so the lip around the edges that I made turned out to be totally useless and lost.

The baked crust
Next, I chilled the crust in the freezer a few minutes to bring it down to room temperature, because my chief taste tester was in a hurry to get home so she could do her online Jazzercise class.

After the crust chilled enough, I spread the topping on, and then cut it into 8 pieces. They look something like this.

Fully assembled and cut into pieces
They were tastier even than I had hoped, and the dark chocolate topping is so rich! I did the math, and each serving is only 3 [SmartPoints](https://www.weightwatchers.com/us/how-it-works/smartpoints).
