Occasionally I make a meal that is so bad, I throw it in the trash and order delivery. But this was not one of those nights.

Instead, tonight I made something wonderful. Seared sea scallops. Miso corn purée. And a small salad of basil, cucumber, radish, and Roma tomato in champagne vinegar.

It tasted as good as it looks. But that pan will never be the same.
