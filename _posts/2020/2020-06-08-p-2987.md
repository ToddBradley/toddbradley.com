I’m gonna do as President Trump does, not as he says\*\*\*. I hope you’re able to join me and vote by mail.

\*\*\* Years from now, that reference probably won’t make any sense. If you’re in the future, here’s the short explanation. For some reason, among the other really dumb things Trump has said lately is that nobody should vote by mail, because of voter fraud. There are two ironies here. First, [Trump himself votes by mail](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-ever-voted-by-mail/) (as he is [now a resident of Florida](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/31/politics/trump-florida-resident/index.html)). Second, the [Republican Party is encouraging voters to please vote for him by mail.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/trump-republicans-vote-mail-arizona-florida/612625/) The third irony is that voting by mail has better security than voting in person, but I wouldn’t dare bring fact-based thinking into a discussion of President Trump.
