I’ve been trying to cook and eat healthier the past few months, to help support Brooke and me losing some weight. It’s been working, and I’ve been continually challenged to make lower-calorie versions of food I like that don’t taste like crap.


So, when my box of pre-selected produce from the farmers market had potatoes, I knew I had a challenge ahead of me. Potatoes are exactly what I should not be eating. They have almost no nutritional value, and are high in carbohydrates, something I should avoid as a diabetic. With Independence Day coming up, I set my [thinking toque](https://genius.com/Bob-and-doug-mckenzie-twelve-days-of-christmas-lyrics) toward making some potato salad. Here’s the result.


Ingredients:


* 2 cups of diced potatoes
* 1 dill pickle spear, chopped
* 1 cup chopped celery
* 1 T chopped white onion
* 1/4 cup yogurt
* 1 T Dijon mustard
* 1/2 package of fresh dill, chopped
* Juice from 1/2 lemon
* Salt and pepper

After dicing the potatoes, cook them in boiling water for about 10 or 12 minutes. Meanwhile, chop all the veggies.


Throw everything except the potatoes (which are still cooking, duh) into a bowl and stir it all together.


Once the potatoes are done, run them under cold water in a colander.

After they’ve cooled mostly, throw those into the bowl, and stir everything around to coat the potatoes. Put it all in the fridge for an hour to let everything mingle and chill. Stir again, then serve.

Everything mixed together, ready for refrigeration to occur
This recipe makes three American size servings, perfect for the 4th of July with your sweetheart and some leftovers. Scale it up as needed.


This has about 1/3 the calories as store-bought potato salad for servings that are twice as big. I call that a success.
