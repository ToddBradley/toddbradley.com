I’m experimenting with [PB2 powdered peanut butter](https://pb2foods.com/products/original-powdered-peanut-butter/) today. Here’s my first recipe, for some spicy peanut sauce. This would go well on chicken tenders.

## Ingredients

- 4 Tbsp peanut butter powder
- 3 Tbsp water
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp sriracha
- 1 Tbsp rice vinegar

Put it in a bowl and stir it all together. There’s not much to it.

Note: If you don’t like spicy food, use only half a tablespoon of sriracha instead.
