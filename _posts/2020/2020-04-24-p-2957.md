I’m doing some digital spring cleaning, going through a bunch of random old notes on my computer. And I came across part of a recipe for green chile stew that I made up to reflect what I was making. This was meant to emulate the green chile stew I had at [the View Restaurant at the Monument Valley visitor center](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g57072-d1513867-Reviews-The_View_Restaurant-Monument_Valley_Utah.html).

The thing is, I didn’t really write a full recipe, just a list of ingredients. I do that a lot, since usually they’re just to jog my memory later, and how to put the ingredients together is pretty obvious. Hopefully it’ll be obvious to you, too.

If I ever wrote down details, it would be things like “add enough cumin for it to taste good” or “cook it until it looks and smells right”. Do you cook the same way?

Here’s the list:

- 4 pounds lamb roast cut into stew chunks, browned
- Chopped white onion
- Hominy
- Chopped roasted green chiles
- Chicken broth
- Beef broth
- Diced canned tomatoes
- 3 zucchini
- 3 yellow squash
- 2 large potatoes
- Ground red chile
- Oregano
- Salt
- Pepper
- Cumin
- 6 cloves garlic
