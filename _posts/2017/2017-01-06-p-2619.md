It’s been a while since I posted a recipe. Well, actually, it’s been a while since I’ve posted anything here. But it’s time for a recipe.


I like coffee. And I occasionally like chocolate. But I prefer good coffee and dark chocolate. Also, I don’t have an espresso machine at home, so I can’t make a real mocha latte. But with a little experimentation I’ve found a way to make a coffee+chocolate drink at home that’s just as good as a mocha latte.


It’s really a mix of two things - strong coffee and strong chocolate.

n whatever mug you’re going to drink it from, mix about 3/4 cup of half-and-half with 2 tablespoons of [Trader Joe’s Sipping Chocolate](https://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Chocolate-Inspired-Tradition/dp/B006BMOEEE) powder. Microwave this for 30 seconds, and stir. You don’t want it getting too hot, of course, but it needs to be hot enough so the half-and-half dissolves the chocolate. If you need to nuke it longer, go for it.



While the sipping chocolate cools, make one Aeropress full of coffee concentrate, using whatever your favorite beans are. Every Aeropress user has a slightly different technique. Did you know there’s an annual competition to see who can make the best coffee from an Aeropress? There is. The technique I use came from one of the winners of that contest.

I use the [inverted Aeropress method](https://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/) with roughly 17g freshly ground coffee and 190 F tap water. I stir for 10 seconds, then let it steep for another 60 seconds. I prefer Ethiopian [Yirgacheffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgachefe) beans, and use a [metal mesh](https://www.amazon.com/Filter-Original-AeroPress-Built-Guaranteed/dp/B00A1GVVMY) instead of the paper filters that come with the Aeropress.


If you’ve never used an Aeropress, you should get one. It makes better coffee than any other method except a pro-grade espresso machine, and cleans up easily. The coffee that comes out of it is stronger than most coffee, so most people dilute it with 25% to 50% hot water. But for this recipe, we’re not going to dilute it at all.


After the 60 seconds is up, press the coffee concentrate out into your mug with the cocoa concentrate. Now stir them together, and enjoy.


The richness of the half-and-half (instead of milk) and the concentrated coffee flavor make this drink not taste like the sickly sweet mochas you find at some coffee shops.
