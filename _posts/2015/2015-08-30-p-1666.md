I bought a couple TSA-compatible luggage locks from Amazon. My plan was to use this on my new [eBags TLS Workstation Laptop Backpack](http://www.ebags.com/product/ebags/tls-workstation-laptop-backpack/143143?productid=10126287) to secure my laptop and other stuff during our travels through Asia later this year. Unrelated to this, I also couldn’t remember the combination to one of my suitcases that also has a TSA-compatible 3-digit combination lock. And I found a video that explains how easy it is to open (some of) these locks, so that you can reset the combination when you forget it.

So I wondered if the same trick would apply to the [new luggage locks](http://www.amazon.com/Tarriss-TSA-Lock-Lifetime-Warranty/dp/B00Q0PACEI) I bought on Amazon from Tarriss. The trick worked quite well, and I can now break into my own locked items in as little as 12 seconds. That means a real thug could probably break in much faster. And that means there’s no way I’m trusting these locks on my luggage.

I made a little video showing how easy it is to “pick” these locks with your bare hands.
