Updated December 23, 2015

I left Denver with a big yellow suitcase and a blue eBags.com computer backpack. They were both loaded nearly to the max. For Qantas, “the max” means that the checked luggage (my yellow suitcase) can’t exceed 23 kg, and the carry on (my blue backpack) can’t exceed 7 kg). They were at 22 and 7, respectively. I measured. I even threw stuff out a couple nights before we left so I could get under the weight limit. That’s why I left America without dress pants, and with only one long sleeved shirt.

From a clothes perspective, the biggest challenge is the extremes in weather. In the same “vacation” we’re spending a few days in nearly-freezing rain and wind on the South Island of New Zealand, but we’re also spending a few weeks right at the equator. For hot weather and humidity, I want clothes that are light and dry fast. For cold weather, I want thick warm layers.

But there are other non-clothes items that I’m sure are just going to get ejected from my kit along the way. So I decided to make a little journal of it. I’m not counting food or toiletries or stuff like that. Just bigger stuff.

Here’s what got added or removed along the way:


### New South Wales, Australia

+ blue jeans from Target in Sydney
+ blue thick cotton sweatshirt from Target in Sydney
- “[You Are Here](http://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Here-Photographs-International/dp/0316379646)” book, given to Australian Red Cross

### Queensland, Australia

+ GoPro floating handle with wrist strap
+ sunglasses (“sunnies”)
+ Australia tourist hat for 2.99 AUD

### North Island, New Zealand

+ cheap knit cap that covers the ears, sold at the cheap Chinese stuff store
+ guide book on Cambodia
+ guide book on Indonesia
+ two laminated maps
- two bottles of Flonase, empty pill bottle, lip balm

Hmm, so far, I’m acquiring more than I’m leaving behind. This has to change. These are steps in the wrong direction. Stay tuned…

### South Island, New Zealand

I got rid of a lot of stuff the night before we flew from Christchurch to Indonesia. Some things I had brought from America thinking I would use them at some point, but haven’t. Others were things I acquired along the way that I knew I wouldn’t need in the tropics.

Beth got rid of some things, too, and we filled up a large plastic bag that our AirBnB host said he would donate to charity for us. After that, my big suitcase closed a lot easier and weight noticeably less. That made me happy.

- blue jeans from Target in Sydney
- blue thick cotton sweatshirt from Target in Sydney
- Goorin hat, sad to see this go but it keeps blowing off in high wind
- cheap knit cap that covers the ears, sold at the cheap Chinese stuff store
- playing cards I bought at a yard sale in Denver earlier this year
- travel domino set that I’d owned for years and never used
- swim goggles, used only twice during my adult swim lessons
- micro USB cable, one of a few that I have
- misc printed things including my D&D 5e character from Sydney (Professor Jazz Hands)
- red checked cotton shirt from REI
- olive shorts that I convinced myself I don’t need because I have another pair of shorts and a swim suit
- 1 pair underwear (I brought more than I need)
- 2 pairs short socks (I brought more than I need)
- Panasonic incandescent headlamp, owned for years but bulky

### Java, Indonesia

![IMG_0268](/assets/img/converted/IMG_0268-400x300.jpg)

### Bangkok, Thailand

+ iPhone 6s
+ iPhone 6s case

### Cambodia

+ booklet from Tuol Sleng (the Phnom Penh Genocide Museum)



### Kansas City, USA

This wasn’t supposed to be a stop on our journey, but it was. I went from Thailand, where the temperatures range between 80 and 90 ?, to Kansas City, where temperatures range between 28 and 60 ?. That required some wardrobe changes. Also, I didn’t have anything worthy of wearing to a funeral service. So here is what I added:


+ Børn shoes, Wrangler blue jeans, long sleeve green shirt, green sweater, khaki slacks


The flip side is that I got rid of a lot. I took advantage of low postal service rates (compared to sending things from Asia to America) to ship all this stuff to my parents’ house in Colorado, where they’ll hold on to it until I can pick it up next year sometime.
