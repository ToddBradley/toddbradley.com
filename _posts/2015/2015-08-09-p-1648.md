As we prepare to leave Denver, we’ve got a lot of stuff to get rid of. Here’s the current list, just in case any of my friends are interested in this stuff. I’ll update this as we add more or sell things.


* Kata camera backpack - [Here’s the Craigslist ad](http://denver.craigslist.org/pho/5175187564.html). I’m only asking $75. It’s a pretty specialized piece of equipment, but very useful if you’re one of the few who need something like this.
* GIVEN AWAY: Exploding Corpse Productions work shirts - I think Chad A wants one of these, but I have at least one more to give away. Since I shuttered the business, I don’t really need the shirts any more.
* GIVEN AWAY: portable 250 GB USB hard drive - Michelle said she wanted this, but that was a month ago and it’s still sitting here in the living room
* GIVEN AWAY: 1 TB SATA hard drive, bare - I no longer need this backup drive.
* SOLD: 2010 Toyota Prius III - I’ll post more details here once I finish a Craigslist ad for it.  90k miles. Meticulously cared-for mechanically, but somewhat worn cosmetically. Kelley Blue Book says it’s worth about $9900.
* SOLD: Sony HDR-AX2000 video camera and tons of accessories - [Here is the Craigslist ad for this](http://denver.craigslist.org/pho/5149174422.html). I’m selling it for $1750.
* SOLD: Blackmagic Design Intensity Shuttle for Thunderbolt video interface - [Here is the Craigslist ad for this](http://denver.craigslist.org/sop/5107627891.html). I’m selling it for $145.
* DONATED: we need to get rid of nearly all our furniture, including:

beautiful bar-height dining table (solid wood with natural finish) with four chairs
big red couch (Goodwill grade)
two desks (Goodwill grade)
* DONATED: two backpacks, two camera bags
* DONATED: a Therm-a-Rest backpacking mattress with Therm-a-Rest-R seat converter
* SOLD and GIVEN AWAY: several prints - framed and unframed - of Beth’s photos
