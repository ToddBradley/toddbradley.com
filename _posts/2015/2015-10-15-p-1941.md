I shot this video at one of the feeding stations at the Tanjung Puting National Park in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. It’s a mother orangutan and her child. I just loved the way that she went from one tree to the next by causing the entire tree to sway back and forth, with child clinging on for dear life. The background is bright grey due to the extreme amounts of smoke in the atmosphere caused by farmers burning down the jungle where the orangutans live in order to create more room for the farmers’ crops.
