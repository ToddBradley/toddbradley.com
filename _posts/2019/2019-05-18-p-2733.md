I asked the server at the new neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant which she recommends - the pho or the lemongrass rice noodle bowl. She thought for a moment and said that since it’s not hot outside today, I shouldn’t have the soup. It’s funny how many people think the opposite - that pho is for cool weather.
