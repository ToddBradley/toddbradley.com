Someone has made 12 fraudulent charges on one of my Visa credit cards since May 31, including buying 6 airline tickets on Allegiant Air, renting U-Haul trucks several times, and staying in a couple hotels.


Now, of course, the bank has canceled my card and are sending me a new one that’ll arrive Monday or so. What a hassle.


That reminds me - didn’t Apple announce some new Apple credit card thing with a rotating number to prevent fraud? I should go read about that sometime. Oh, here it is: [https://www.apple.com/apple-card/privacy-security/](https://www.apple.com/apple-card/privacy-security/)
