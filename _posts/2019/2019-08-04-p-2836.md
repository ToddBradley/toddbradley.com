When I have time, some weekends I make muffin tin omelets, also sometimes called no-crust quiche. It makes it easy for me to have a high protein, low carb breakfast throughout the week. In the past, I’ve used a fairly shallow muffin tin. But that makes muffin tin omelets that aren’t quite enough to satisfy me, while eating two of them is too much food for breakfast. So I decided I needed a larger size muffin tin. Last time I visited my parents, I learned Mom had a spare! So I took it home with me.


Like my old one, the new tin holds 6 muffins, but each one is much deeper. Today, I finally had time to make some muffin tin omelets again. If you’ve never made these, you should try it sometime. You can find a ton of recipes online, so I’m not going to give you all the details, but here is the general idea.

Today, the things I put in were:


* some leftover BBQ brisket, chopped
* one red bell pepper, chopped and sauteed in the fat from the brisket
* one roma tomato I got from the farmer’s market two weeks ago and realized I better use before it’s too late
* cheddar/jack cheese blend
* 9 eggs - so each omelet is 1.5 eggs
* some milk - don’t ask me how much, I don’t measure stuff, that’s not how I cook
* salt, black pepper, umami pepper

What, you don’t know about umami pepper? I found this thing on a “if we can’t sell it, we’re just going to throw it out” rack at Safeway a couple years ago and it was the most wonderful discovery.


Then I baked it until it looked good to me. That turned out to be 30 minutes at 350 degrees. And here is the result:

They sure look good, but I already ate lunch, so I’ll save these for later.


I had a bit of trouble getting them out of the muffin tin, maybe I need to coat the pan with something greasier next time. Or cook them inside of muffin cups.
