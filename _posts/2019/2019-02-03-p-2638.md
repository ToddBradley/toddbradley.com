Like a lot of people in Colorado, I like green chile. Denver is a 9 hour drive from Hatch, New Mexico, but we’re close enough to be in the orbit of Hatch chiles. So when I got an Instant Pot for Christmas, I decided to try to use it to make pork green chile.

The green chiles I got were a gift from a friend who bought a bushel and did all the prep work (thanks, KY!) so I just have a pile of quart-size Ziploc baggies of green chiles ready to use. This batch is a bit on the spicy side, I found, hotter than Anaheims. Maybe they’re [Big Jims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_chile). I don’t honestly know.

Full green chiles, roasted and prepped
My experience wasn’t perfect, and during the process, I realized a fundamental truth I’d never thought much about. Colorado-style green chile sauce that you’d use to put on a burrito or eggs is a lot spicier than Colorado-style green chile that you eat like soup with tortillas. My original goal was to make the former, but I ended up with the latter. Next time I’ll do it differently, I think. Here goes with the recipe.

## Ingredients

- 2 to 3 pounds of pork shoulder, diced
- 1 quart bag of prepped green chiles
- 6 tomatillos
- 1 medium yellow onion
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tsp Mexican oregano (a totally different plant than European oregano)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp ground dried New Mexico chile
- 1 tsp ground black pepper
- 1 32 ounce (weight) chicken broth, plus 2 more cups of broth
- 2 cups of water
- 1 can of diced tomatoes
- corn starch

De-husk, wash, and cut up the tomatillos, garlic, and onion. Blend them together in a blender.

This is about the right amount of onion, tomatillo, and pork to use.
Dice the pork and dice the green chiles (separately).

Set the Instant Pot for Sauté, add 1 TB of oil, and brown the pork.

Add the blended stuff, the green chiles, the chicken broth, the tomatoes, and the spices. Seal the IP and set for pressure cook High for 75 minutes. Yes, 75 minutes. You want the pork to be so soft it melts in your mouth. When it’s done, let the steam do the “natural release” for another 30 minutes.

First look after opening the Instant Pot lid

Before thickening
Switch the Instant Pot back to Sauté. Make a [slurry of corn starch](https://www.thespruceeats.com/thicken-a-sauce-with-cornstarch-996071) and water, and slowly add enough, stirring into the soup to thicken it up.

Once it seems thick enough, serve it up with warm flour tortillas.

You can also use this to smother burritos and eggs, but my taste buds say it’s not spicy enough for that.
