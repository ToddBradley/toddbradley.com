It’s done. I just deleted my Facebook and Instagram accounts. It was fun for a few years, but the relationship turned sour after one of us started lying to the other, then pretended to take steps to improve but just kept lying.

Separation took a few months of planning and preparation. Here’s the blog post I wrote about this process several months ago:

So what am I doing now for social media? Over the past 9 months or so, I’ve gravitated to a mix of Reddit, Twitter, my blog, and MeWe.


* Reddit is great for complex discussions - not perfect, but way better than Facebook
* Twitter is great for sharing quick thoughts that I used to put in Facebook posts
* My old WordPress blog is great for sharing longer essays, recipes, etc.
* And MeWe is a good way to meet other people with shared interests
