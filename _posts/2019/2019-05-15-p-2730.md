I’m a little excited about the trailer for this film, “Godzilla: King of the Monsters”. But wait a minute, isn’t Godzilla a “she”? Shouldn’t it be “Godzilla: Queen of the Monsters”?

Well, Wikipedia to the rescue:

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla)

“Godzilla was referred to as a male and was depicted laying eggs through parthenogenesis.” I don’t know what parthenogenesis means, but I guess it means males can lay eggs.

So, never mind.
