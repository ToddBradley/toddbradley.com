Earlier this week I learned about a recall of MacBook Pro computers from 2015. So I went here to read more:

And I learned that my personal laptop is part of the recall! I wonder if they were going to proactively contact me, since Apple know that computer belongs to me and where to find me. Regardless, I contacted them and am now taking it in to the Apple Store next Tuesday for warranty service to have the battery replaced.

It is supposed to take 1 to 2 weeks, but I guess that’s better than having the battery explode while I’m using it.
