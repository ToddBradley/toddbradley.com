I just made dinner reservations at Emeril’s New Orleans, his “flagship” restaurant. My department at work is going to New Orleans next month for a three day planning meeting. So I decided to lead a group outing to get some great food on the first night. I haven’t been to this restaurant before - only read about it. But I have been to one of Emeril’s other restaurants and everything there was outstanding. So I’m excited for some good gumbo and boudin balls.
