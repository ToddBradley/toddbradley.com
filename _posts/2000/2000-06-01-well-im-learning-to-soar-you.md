Well, I’m learning to soar.  You know, flying a
glider.  Yes, a plane with no engine.  I started taking soaring
lessons in the spring of 2000.  Progress is slow.  I’m a terrible
student, but I’m keeping with it.  I’ve been learning at [Mile
High Gliding](http://www.milehighgliding.com/) in Boulder.  Here’s what the glider port looks like right
