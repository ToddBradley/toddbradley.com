Well, Christmas is nearly
here.  I’m almost done with my shopping and may finish the rest up this
weekend.  We watched The Avengers last night on DVD.  It
pretty much sucked.  Maybe I’d like it more if I were a fan of the
original TV series.

My pet peeve of the day is for-profit companies that don’t
read and reply to their email.  This has happened to me twice in the
past week.  First is the Harry Fox Agency, a company that licenses
songs written by one person for use in a recording by another.  They
have a website and a customer service email address for questions, but a
week after sending them a question by email, they still haven’t responded.
The other time this happened to me this week is with a company called
Colorado Weddings, which - as you may have guessed - organizes weddings in
Colorado.  They also have an email address, to which I sent a note
requesting more information on north Denver venues they work with.
Still no response.

Speaking of email, last week my hatred of spam email finally
came to a head.  I realized that well over 50% of the mail I was
getting was spam, so I shut down one of my email accounts that was the
source of a lot of it. I can no longer be reached at
[ToddBradley@bigfoot.com](mailto:ToddBradley@bigfoot.com).
Originally, the Bigfoot concept seemed great.  Their tagline was "Email
for Life" and the idea is that you’d get one email address that you could
use forever, and it would just forward messages to you at another address.
So, you could have it point at your home ISP email and then if you switched
ISPs someday you just point it to the new one.  Well, eventually
realizing they didn’t have a viable business plan, Bigfoot started making a
requirement that if you were going to use their "free" email for life
service, you have to accept advertisements delivered to your mailbox.
In the end, I wasn’t willing to do that, so I canceled my service.
Also, I looked at a number of anti-spam programs and settled on one called
Spam Eater Pro, which I purchased.  It filters out spam messages using
two different methods - checking senders’ addresses with a number of
anti-spam services (like ORBS and RBL, two of the most famous) and also
filtering based on regular expressions in the header and body.  Between
those two methods, it’s doing a good job of deleting my spam before it ever
gets to me, and it only cost $25.
