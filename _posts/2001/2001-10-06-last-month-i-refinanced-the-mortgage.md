Last month, I refinanced the
mortgage on our house.  I paid off the existing mortgage plus the car
loans for my
and Honda Civic GX with a new loan from
the [University of Colorado Federal Credit
Union](http://www.uofcfcu.com/) at a much lower (and fixed) rate.  Other than having monthly
payments of about $800 less, one other benefit is that I got a big fat
refund check from the feds for a bunch of mortgage insurance I’d paid (since
the previous loan was from FHA and required mortgage insurance).

So, with the check from the Department of the Treasury
filling my pocket, I decided to go on a shopping spree and buy some outdoors
clothes and equipment that I’ve wanted for a long while.  I got:

- [Columbia hat](http://www.columbia.com/products/pr_detail.cfm?product_id=48) - I’m running out of baseball caps and wanted something
  that isn’t made of cotton.
- [Marmot Catskill sleeping bag](http://www.marmot.com/products/bags/bag_prod_hv_catskill.html) - Why do I need another sleeping
  bag when I already have 3?  Well, one of them is a double wide for
  summertime camping with Beth.  One is 20 years old and doesn’t
  insulate very well anymore.  And one is a very warm mummy
  bag that has zippers that always catch and doesn’t work well for someone
  who sleeps on his side and rolls around a lot (that’s me).  This
  Marmot semi-rectangular bag doesn’t have the insulation value of the
  Cabela’s mummy bag, but it’s got an awesome zipper design, with special
  panels sewn into the bag to prevent the zippers from catching on the
  fabric.
- [Pacific Trail Pac
  Tech Terrain jacket](http://www.pacifictrail.com/) - I’ve wanted a true waterproof
  breathable shell for a long time.  I had a decent water resistant
  shell but I gave it away and it wasn’t fully waterproof.  This one
  is great.
- [Galyan’s](http://www.galyans.com/) brand
  polar fleece sleeping bag - supposedly you’d use this for summertime
  camping, but I bought it as a liner for my new sleeping bag for times
  it’s cold.
- [HydRID LightWeight](http://www.duofold.com/thermal/hydrid.htm) long sleeve t-shirt - If you’ve never owned any
  clothes made of [CoolMax](http://www.dupont.com/coolmax), you
  should.  CoolMax is the most awesome fabric I’ve seen.  It
  wicks sweat away from your skin really nicely - 5 times faster than
  cotton, they say - but is as comfortable as cotton.  I bought a
  pair of CoolMax underwear several months ago for wearing while hiking
  and playing Ultimate Frisbee and when I saw a long sleeve t-shirt made
  of the stuff, I just had to buy it.
