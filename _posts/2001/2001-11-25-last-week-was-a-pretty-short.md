Last week was a pretty short
one for work, but still very busy.  I had Thursday and Friday off for
Thanksgiving and drove to my parents’ house for the holiday.  There, I
met up with Beth, who had been on the Hopi and Navajo reservations as part
of the Traditional Support Caravan.  My aunt invited us to Thanksgiving
dinner at her cafe in Redstone, which was very nice.  I took my cousin
Billy along with me and saw lots of other relatives.  It snowed a
couple times while we were there.

We drove back Saturday so that I could make it to Scott
Siders’ book release part at Stella’s coffee shop in Denver.  He read
some pieces from his new book and did a little duet performance thing with
Josh, who also played with a musical group.

Now I’m home trying to get caught up on things - bills,
email, etc.  Also, I’m going to start Christmas shopping.  But
before I do that, I’ll update my online wish list.
