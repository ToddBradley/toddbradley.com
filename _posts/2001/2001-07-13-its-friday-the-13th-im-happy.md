It’s Friday the 13th.  I’m happy
to say that no more bad things have happened to me since my last entry.
My ankle’s mostly healed.

I am officially unemployed now, and should be collecting
unemployment insurance before long.  Jabber.com, the software startup
where I’d been working for the past year, gave me an insultingly low
severance pay of 2 weeks salary, which ran out last week.  I can’t
really blame them for including me in their layoff; it’s hard to justify
having a high paid customer support manager when you don’t have any
customers.  Clearly, the original expectations of having a viable
product in late 2000 and customers lining up at the door were grossly out of
line.  But I do hope things turn around for them.  They’ve got the
start of a great product and some good people.

Moving on to bigger and better things, I’ve decided to take
this opportunity to do something I’ve been talking and thinking about for
four years now - start my own consulting practice.  My new company is
called Zang Spur Consulting.  It’s an independent consulting practice
specializing in customer support and quality assurance consulting to
software organizations.  Most of my time the past three weeks has gone
to trying to learn how to set up a business like this - legal and financial
concerns, finding clients, etc.

In personal news, I attended the wedding of my cousin Megan
and her new husband J.J.  It was in Redstone, CO on July 1, and was a
very nice ceremony.  I got to see both of my brothers (Matt and Kent)
at the same time, which is rare.

Also, I’ve gone soaring a couple of times.  Earlier
this week, I made my first solo takeoff without a "line boy", meaning that I
hooked up my own tow rope and launched without a wing runner.  That
same flight was my first solo flight where I did any significant soaring,
gaining a few hundred feet of altitude in a squirrelly thermal over east
Boulder.
