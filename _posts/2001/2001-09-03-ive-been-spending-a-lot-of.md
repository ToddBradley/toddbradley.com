I’ve been spending a lot of
time in my recording studio the past few days, making good progress on a lot
of new songs for the next [404 Not Found](http://www.404notfound.net/)
CD.  Also, I just scanned in an old photo of me at age 16.  Go see
the Todd Through The Years page [Ed. - It’s now [here](../photos/photos1/)] to see it.
