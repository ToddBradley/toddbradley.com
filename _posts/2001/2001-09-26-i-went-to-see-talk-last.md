I went to see
[Chris Locke](http://www.washspkrs.com/speaker.cfm/3732) talk
last night at the [RMIUG](http://www.rmiug.org/) meeting.
He’s not as [freaky](http://www.rageboy.com/) as I expected.
In fact, his talk was really quite good.  I may even buy his
[new book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204080/qid=1001535639/sr=2-1/ref=sr_8_7_1/107-3469280-0767759), though I thought
[Cluetrain Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204315/ref=bxgy_sr_text_a/107-3469280-0767759) was a
[bit tedious](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-reviews/-/A2YHU2LV32CKNO/107-3469280-0767759).

Also, for the past two days I’ve been immersed in my project
to cook [blue corn lamb tamales](../recipes/#Tamales).
Well, I’m finally done and they came out pretty decent for my first attempt.
I spent a couple hours this afternoon writing up the recipe for them, as
well as writing a recipe for [borracho beans](../recipes/#Borracho)
and finishing my recipe for [smothering chili](../recipes/#Chili).
They’re all on my [recipe page](../recipes/).

Tonight I’m going to watch the series premier of
Enterprise.

Sure wish someone would leave a note in my
[guestbook](http://pub36.bravenet.com/guestbook/show.php?usernum=3087332100&cpv=1).  Maybe nobody reads my online journal.
