I finished another book this
morning.  That makes 4 I’ve finished in the past week - Cowboy Slang,
Sun Chief: The Autobiography of a Hopi Indian, Alexander the Great
and the Logistics of the Macedonian Army, and Hopi Dwellings.
I decided it was time to go write some book reviews for Amazon.com, too,
which I did.  I’d like to say it’s now time for some fiction.  But
out of the 14 books left on my "books to read" [shelf](/),
13 are nonfiction.
