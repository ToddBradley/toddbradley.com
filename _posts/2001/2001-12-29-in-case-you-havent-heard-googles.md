In case you haven’t heard,
Google’s extensive [USENET
archive](http://www.google.com/grphp?hl=en) is
[finally online](http://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html).  It represents 20 years of Internet history, dating
way back before there was a World Wide Web.  It’s great to see
all these articles being preserved for posterity.

Just for grins, I did a search for myself to see how far
back I could trace my online history.  Turns out that
[my very first USENET article](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=author:Todd+author:Bradley&hl=en&as_drrb=b&as_mind=12&as_minm=5&as_miny=1981&as_maxd=29&as_maxm=12&as_maxy=1990&rnum=2&selm=29337%40boulder.Colorado.EDU) was posted on November 6, 1990.  I
thought it would have been earlier than that, but I guess not.  That
was my 9th and final semester as an undergrad at the University of Colorado.
In December, I would graduate with a BS in Aerospace Engineering Sciences
and then in January I’d start graduate school.  Here are some other
funny subjects I was involved in all those years ago:

[My mail order bride want ad](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=author:Todd+author:Bradley&start=860&hl=en&rnum=863&selm=995%40pvi.UUCP)
I was looking for someone who could cook and
clean plus take over my job at PVI writing Fortran code.
Note my self-assumed title of Supreme Ruler of the Galaxy.

February 24, 1992

[First mention of the woman who would become my life partner,
Beth Partin](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=author:Todd+author:Bradley&start=780&hl=en&rnum=785&selm=1992Feb24.060535.26793%40ucsu.Colorado.EDU)
I had been dating Beth for less than a month
when I posted this.  I guess I’ve gotten used to kissing
someone with glasses!  Also note that by this time I was
signing my name as "Todd." which is something I still do to this
day (any of you who have ever gotten an email from me know this
to be true).  
Also, notice the fake middle name "Slan" in my signature:

Todd "Slan" Bradley-Postmodern Reaganomics Renaissance Man,
The Exception to Every Rule, An Example To All Men, The Biggest
Jerk In The World, Supreme Ruler Of The Galaxy, AND Captain of
The Unnamed Computer Science Ultimate Frisbee Team.\*\*\*

November 11, 1992

[On the Dynamics of Rotating Sport Discs](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=author:Todd+author:Bradley&start=680&hl=en&rnum=689&selm=1992Nov15.224528.1247%40ucsu.Colorado.EDU)
This is the paper I wrote to get a Masters
degree at CU.  To this day, many people don’t believe me
when I say I got a Masters Degree in Aerospace Engineering by
studying the flight of frisbees.  Here’s proof.

\*\*\*  If you’ll forgive a tangent for a moment, each of
the items in my signature has a history, and I’ll explain them now:

Slan: I once got a letter from CU addressed to Todd
Slan Bradley.  My middle name’s Alan, and S is just one letter away
from A on the keyboard, so someone clearly made a typo when entering that.
I thought Slan sounded like a cool, Slavic name and so I used it as a
pseudonym for a while.

Postmodern Reaganomics Renaissance Man: A coworker of
mine at Precision Visuals named Matt Powell gave me this title one day.
He was impressed at the amount of computer and non-computer trivia I knew.

The Exception to Every Rule:  I wish I could
remember the context, but I’m pretty sure that Jaye Lampe gave me this name.

An Example To All Men:  Hmm, I can’t remember
where this came from.

The Biggest Jerk In The World: In high school, I had
a friend named Daren Deffenbaugh.  His sister Julie called me this one
day when I was bugging her about something or other.  The title stuck
in my mind because it’s such an absolute.  If I can be better at
something - anything - than the other 6 billion people on the planet, that
makes me feel pretty good.

Supreme Ruler Of The Galaxy:  When I lived in
Libby Hall at CU, one of the other guys on our floor was a very soft spoken
fellow named Bill.  When anyone would ask him what he wanted to do when
he graduated, he’d always say he wanted to become a king.  He was
totally serious about it, too.  And so I figured if Bill can aspire to
be a king, I can aspire to even greater power.

Captain of the Unnamed Computer Science Ultimate Frisbee
Team:  Even though I wasn’t a Computer Science student, I hung
around with lots of them.  I somehow got elected to captain their
Ultimate team, and I think the team was later named "The Flying Bitheads".
