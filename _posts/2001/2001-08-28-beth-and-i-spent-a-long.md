Beth and I spent a long weekend in
the mountains.  On Friday we drove from our house in Broomfield to the
Denver Creek Campground.  Saturday, we visited another local reservoir
to watch birds and got ice cream in the town of Hot Sulphur Springs.
Then we drove to Winter Park and rode the
Alpine Slide and saw the oompah band that was playing there for
Octoberfest.  Then, it was back to our camp for dinner.  Sunday,
we leisurely broke camp and headed home by way of
[Rocky Mountain National Park](http://www.nps.gov/romo/).
On the drive home, we saw coyotes, antelope, moose, elk, and deer.  All
in one day!  We stopped at the Alpine Vistors Center and later stopped
for a short hike up to
[Alberta
Falls](http://www.swparks.com/us/travel/colorado/picalberta4.html), where I asked Beth to marry me.  She agreed, and we hiked
back down the mountain and drove to Estes Park where we had a very mediocre
meal at a Mexican restaurant.  We got home fairly late Sunday night.
