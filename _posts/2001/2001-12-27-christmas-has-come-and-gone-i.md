Christmas has come and gone!
I got some nice gifts and for the most part had a quiet day at home.
My parents visited from Thursday through Sunday, and Beth and I spent
Christmas day just the two of us.  I worked the day before and the day
after, while most of my coworkers took those days off.  For Christmas,
I got several CDs, a couple DVDs, two GURPS Traveller books, some toys, and
some money to buy more toys.  Don’t know what I’ll spend the
money on, yet.

We went to see the long awaited Fellowship of the Ring
movie on opening day last Wednesday.  And we liked it so much, we went
to see it again on Christmas.  It’s a great film and is now voted as
the #1 movie of all time by readers of IMDB.com.

I’ve been making good progress mixing the next 404 Not Found
CD.  I made the first test CD and made lots of notes about how it
sounds on various equipment.  Now it’s back to the studio to remix some
tracks and remaster others.

Here’s an idea I had a long time ago, that I’ve been meaning
to write down here.  This came to me while I was driving home from my
parents house at Thanksgiving in my NGV.
One of the most important features of this car is that it has incredibly low
emissions, a point that’s accentuated when driving over the mountain passes
on the highway along with all the diesel trucks and SUVs that pour out
smelly black and blue clouds for miles and miles.  I was thinking the
gasoline companies should research fuel additives that give off various
designer scents when burned.  I imagined a special gasoline that
smells like milk chocolate when it burns.  That would sure make
highway driving in traffic a lot more pleasant!

Perhaps part of what made me think of that was an article I
read about a guy who has a car that runs on leftover fry oil from
restaurants.  He says that the car puts out fumes that smell like
wherever the oil came from.  So if he gets used oil from a chicken
joint, his exhaust smells like KFC.  Or other times, it smells like
fresh french fries.  Even if it’s not chocolate, that sounds nicer than
the usual burning diesel smell.
