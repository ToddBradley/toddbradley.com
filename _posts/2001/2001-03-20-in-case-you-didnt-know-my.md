In case
you didn’t know, my birthday marks the first day of spring.  Beth
took me to Gasho of Japan for supper, and then we went home to watch a
movie on DVD.  I’ve been watching lots of classics on DVD and I
highly recommend [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/).

December
7, 2000:  I finally made my first solo flight in a glider!
I took the day off work to get in some glider lessons.  After four
flights with my instructor, John Campbell, I took one by myself.  I
expected to be very nervous, but wasn’t.  In fact, it was nice to fly
around without someone chattering nonstop in the back seat (just as he
told me it would be).  Here’s the traditional Polaroid photo of me
right after landing.  [Click](<images/First%20Solo%20(big).jpg>)

October 2000:  I’m now scooter enabled.  I
bought a [Xootr](http://www.xootr.com/xootr/default.asp) [Cruz](http://shop.xootr.com/xootr/cruz2.asp)
and am now trying to learn to ride it.  If you’d like to buy one,
[ask
me](mailto:todd@toddbradley.com) how I can easily save you 5% on the purchase.

September 2000:  I’ve upgraded my two PCs and I’m
trying to build a third to run Linux.  Unfortunately, I’ve had quite a few
problems simply ordering parts!  Read [this](/)
to see why I recommend you stay away from Advanced Design of Kentucky.

Summer 2000:  Well, I’m learning to soar.  You know, flying a
glider.  Yes, a plane with no engine.  I started taking soaring
lessons in the spring of 2000.  Progress is slow.  I’m a terrible
student, but I’m keeping with it.  I’ve been learning at [Mile
High Gliding](http://www.milehighgliding.com/) in Boulder.  Here’s what the glider port looks like right
now [Ed. - link doesn’t work anymore].
