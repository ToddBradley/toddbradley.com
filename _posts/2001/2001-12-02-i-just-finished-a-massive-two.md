I just finished a massive two day
project to revamp the photos section of this site.  My photos from my
[October 2001 vacation](../oct2001/oct2001_page1/) are finally
up, along with notes of where I went.  Plus, I put several scans of old
pictures on the site.  You can find it all from the main
photos page now.

Last night, Beth and I went to see Amelie, a French
film that’s incredibly funny and good.  It’s playing at the Mayan in
Denver.  We’re still looking for a place to have the wedding, and
haven’t seen the perfect location yet.
