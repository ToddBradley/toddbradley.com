I’ve now been running
[Windows XP](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/launch/) for over
a week and it hasn’t crashed or locked up on me once!  That’s about 5
to 10 times better than Windows ME was.  And I found that T[eam
Fortress Classic](http://tfc.pcgame.com/info.html) (TFC) runs better than ever before.

The plot with the car accident last week thickens.  The
kid who ran in to me filed a claim against my insurance.  The insurance
inspector (claim adjustor) took recorded statements by telephone with both
of us and denied the kid’s claim because she felt I was not at fault.
So, that leaves me with two choices.  I could either file a claim on
the other driver’s insurance and hope they find him to be at fault (in which
case I don’t have a deductible to pay), or I can just forget it and file a
claim on my collision insurance (in which case I have to pay a $500
deductible).  Well, I did the first one and then found out from the
other driver’s insurance that he is an "exempted driver" for the car that he
was driving.  So, they will be denying my claim based on that.
But to me that sounds like he was driving without insurance, which is a
fairly serious crime in Colorado!  So now I’m not sure what’s going to
happen next.  Will my insurance company take him to court?  Will
they ask the police to arrest or ticket him for driving without insurance?
We’ll see.

Let’s see.  What else happened this week?

Well, Monday night Beth and I went to Sushi Zanmai’s annual
invitation-only party.  It was at the former JC Penney location in the
nearly dead Crossroads Mall in Boulder.  We got in with no problem, and
then stood in line for nearly two hours to get some of the free sushi that
was the main appeal of the party.  Yes, free sushi!  Then when we
were about 10 people from the front of the line, finally, they ran out of
sushi!  So, after spending the whole night standing in line starving,
we decided we’d had enough of this "party" and went to Sumida’s for
supper.

Halloween was Wednesday night and we had a pretty low
turnout of kids, which means we’ve got lots of candy left over.
Thursday night I watched
[The Tao of
Steve](http://www.spe.sony.com/classics/taoofsteve/above4.html) on DVD; I really liked that movie and would recommend it.
