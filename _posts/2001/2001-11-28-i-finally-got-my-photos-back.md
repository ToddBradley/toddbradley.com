I finally got my photos back from
Snapfish.  The prints are of standard quality, but what I’m really
impressed with is the digital versions.  The computer files, delivered
on CDROM, look really, really good.  They make me look like I’m a real
photographer, rather than some schmoe with a 15 year old point-and-shoot
camera.  I’ve already taken one of the photos and put it up as my
desktop on my PC at home.  I’ll go through them all and do some
cropping and touchups, then incorporate them into my October 2001 travel
log, which is a work in progress.  More on that later.
