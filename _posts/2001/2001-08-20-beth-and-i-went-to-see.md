Beth and I went to see King
Lear performed at the Colorado Shakespeare Festival on Saturday night.
The weather turned out to be great, unlike the show I attended last year,
where I got rained on.  There’s a new burger joint on The Hill in
Boulder, in the space previously occupied by a Korean restaurant, and before
that a Japanese restaurant.  It’s called Thunderbird Burgers.  The
burger was o.k. I guess, but about 3 times as much bun as meat.  They
have these huge homemade style buns.

Last night (Sunday) we went to an open mike night at
Stella’s in south Denver, near DU.  It was pretty good, though a little
bit long for my tastes.  I think 15 different people read, which was
about 3 times as much as I’d prefer.

Tonight and tomorrow night, we’re going bat watching, as
part of the Boulder County Bat Survey.  Assuming the weather’s nice,
that is.  If it’s rainy or windy, we’ll have to postpone for another
day.

Oh, I put a few photos up of
[me on vacation](../photos/canyonlandsphotos/) this spring.

And last night I finished reading William Gibson’s All
Tomorrow’s Parties.  It’s probably not his best work, but
entertaining nonetheless.
