You’re
probably wondering why I don’t update my web page more often.  Well,
I set up a weblog site for myself, [http://tbradley.manilasites.com](http://tbradley.manilasites.com/).
But it’s so slow as to be painful to use.  So maybe I should
just write my thoughts here more often.

The weather’s been getting warmer and nicer.  It’s
really windy today, but I’ve been taking my Xootr to work more often
lately.

Also, it’s not new news anymore, but I upgrade [my
recording studio](http://www.404notfound.net/a7arl.htm) a while back and added a recording booth called a
Whisperroom.  It’s nice.  So, I’ve been spending a bit more time
making music lately.
