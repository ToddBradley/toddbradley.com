Yesterday, Beth and I drove up
to Loveland to look at a possible location for our wedding and reception
called .  It was a nice enough place, but didn’t seem quite right for
what we wanted.  We’ve got a long list of possibilities and I
think it’ll take weeks to evaluate them all.  At some point, we’ll make
a wedding web page, but we don’t have any of the details sorted out yet, so
it would just be blank at this point!

Next week, I’m leaving town to drive to Salt Lake City for
the annual meeting of the [Glen Canyon
Institute](http://www.glencanyon.org/).  It’s going to be a tight schedule since I have to be in
Boulder on Thursday night for the quarterly board of directors meeting for
the [Colorado Bat Society](http://www.coloradobats.org/), of which
I’m the Executive Director.  But the first of the events I want to
attend in SLC starts at 6:00 PM on Friday.  So, I’m starting my road
trip right after the bat meeting.  I’ll make it to Wyoming somewhere
and stay the night and then drive the rest of the way on Friday.  To
save money, I’m planning to camp.  The GCI events are over Saturday
night, and I’ll probably spend Sunday doing some sightseeing in Salt Lake
City since I’ve never been there except to pass through.  Then I’m
taking the scenic route back and will hopefully do some camping and hiking
at some of the places we didn’t have time to visit on our Utah trip in the
spring.  I may hit the San Rafael Swell area, Arches National Park, the
La Sal-to-Gateway road that I’ve always wanted to see, and then visit my
parents in Redstone on the way back over the mountains.

I watched episode #2 of Enterprise last night.
It was o.k.  In some ways, I like the show because it’s so much
different than the previous Star Trek television programs.  But in some
ways I don’t like it because it’s too similar.

What else have I been doing lately?  Always trying to
find new clients for my consulting
business.  Evaluating a diskette of new sounds for my Korg Karma in
preparation for writing a review.  Reading a bunch.  Shopping for
a new sleeping bag.  Playing and practicing Ultimate Frisbee with my
team Big Hair Todd and the Swillers (also called Big Huck Todd and the
Swillers).  Playing and practicing Team Fortress Classic with my team
30+ Team 1.
