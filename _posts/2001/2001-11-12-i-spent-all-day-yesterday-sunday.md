I spent all day yesterday
(Sunday) playing Ultimate.  It was the fall league tournament.  My
team played four games, from about 9:00 AM straight through to about 2:00
PM.  We won the first one, lost the second, won the third, and lost the
fourth.  That first loss put us in the "beer bracket" which we didn’t
win, unfortunately.  But it was good fun.  I haven’t played 4
games in a single day in over a year, so I was fairly tired and sore, but
not as bad as I expected.
