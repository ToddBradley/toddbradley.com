I just got home from the
movie theater.  I went with my friend Mike to see The One, the
new Jet Li movie.  It’s gotten terrible reviews, but I was actually
impressed with it.  I was expecting a real stinker, but this was a good
movie, given that you understand the genre it comes from.  It’s got
great effects and sound, good action and fight scenes, and even a decent
(though not very original - but who would expect such a thing) plot.

Earlier today, my Ultimate Frisbee team had our final
practice of the season.  Tomorrow is the big tournament, and I guess
we’re about as ready as we’re going to be!

I sent five rolls of film to Snapfish this week and
requested prints and a CDROM.  So once those come back, I’ll put some
of them on my website.  The photos are mostly from my vacation to Utah
three weeks ago.
