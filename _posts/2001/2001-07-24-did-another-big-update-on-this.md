Did another big update on this
website, converting everything over to use CSS.  That’s not an overly
simple task in the realm of FrontPage, but it’s done!

As I wrote in my journal entry a couple weeks ago, I’m
starting my own company.  I just sent the paperwork off today to the
Colorado Secretary of State and the IRS.  The company is Zang Spur Consulting LLC.  I’m
setting up a website for it, but it’s still very much under construction.
I’ve been spending the past several days writing a business plan for myself
to serve as a guide over the next few months.

You might be asking yourself, "Where does the name Zang Spur
come from?"  Well, here’s the story:

> Why Zang Spur Consulting?

        Well, I needed a name and I wanted something with some geographical
        significance.  It turns out that in the 19th century, the town now
        known as Broomfield, Colorado was called Zang’s Spur.  

The name comes from the farmer who
lived here, Adolph Zang.  He convinced the local railroad to build
a rail spur out to his farm, to make it easier for him to get his goods
to Denver.  So, that rail spur was known as Zang’s Spur and the
township that formed up around it got the same name.  Sometime in
the 1890’s the name changed to Broomfield, after the fields of broom
corn grown here.
I didn’t like the ’s in Zang’s
Spur, since it made the name tougher to spell and didn’t yield a nice
internet domain name.  So I dropped the ’s and stuck with Zang
Spur.
The City of Broomfield did the same
on the sign for Zang’s Spur Centennial Park, which now simply reads "Zang
Spur Park".
