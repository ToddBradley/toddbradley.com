My doctor says my blood cholesterol
level is too high, so I have to start taking medicine and eating a special
diet to bring things under control.  I’ve always had high cholesterol
and have a family history of cholesterol problems, too.  So, I guess
it’s good to take care of it.

I added a whole bunch of photos to the website today.
There are now several sets of photos all indexed here.  And I’m going to scan some photos from the Canyonlands
vacation we took in the spring.

Also, I’ve been working on revamping the website for the
Glen Canyon Institute over the past week.  It’s huge!  But it
needs help.  And the [Glen Canyon
Institute](http://www.glencanyon.org/) is a very good cause.

In other news, I’ve been reading and watching a fair number
of movies lately, which is a good thing to do when unemployed.
Unfortunately, due to lack of money, I’ve had to put soaring on the back
burner.  So, I canceled my membership with the Mile High Gliding Club.
It was a sad thing to do, but I just don’t have the money for glider rentals
so it doesn’t make sense to pay the monthly dues to the club.
Hopefully I’ll be able to get back into it someday.
