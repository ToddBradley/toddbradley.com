Wow, there’s a lot to add
since my last journal entry.

First off, I just got back from being out of town for a
week.  I left on October 11 for Salt Lake City, where I attended the
annual conference of the Glen Canyon Institute.  It was on Friday and
Saturday and I just barely made it there on time, because I drove and the
roads Friday morning in southern Wyoming were a mess due to some snow, low
temperatures, and extreme wind.  Then, I took the "scenic route" back,
stopping in Canyonlands and Arches National Parks for some camping and
hiking.  I stopped for a day at my parents’ house in
[Redstone, Colorado](http://www.redstonecolorado.com/) and went
fishing on the Colorado River on Friday with my dad.  Then, I finally
got home late on Friday the 19th.  I took lots of photos and am
planning to write up a whole travelogue once I get the pictures developed
and scanned.

The other big news is that I start a new job today.
Unfortunately, the consulting business I put so much heart and soul and
startup money into just hasn’t taken off the way I’d hoped.  And I need
to start paying the bills.  I had heard about a company called
[Voyant Technologies](http://www.voyanttech.com/) from a guy I
worked with at Jabber and he said it was a great place.  So, I talked
to them some.  They had a software QA manager position open and it
sounded like a very good opportunity.  From what I can tell, the
company is very sound, they have a good product for which there’s lots of
demand, and - best of all - the people are great and really seem to know
what they’re doing.  So, they convinced me to come join the team.

While I was on my trip to Utah, I ended up buying some more
camping gear, too.  The best thing is a really cool day pack from REI,
with a Platypus "hydration system" in it.  Maybe I’ll tell you more
about that in a later entry.  Gotta go to work now.
