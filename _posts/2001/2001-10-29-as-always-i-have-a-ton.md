As always, I have a ton of
news since I last wrote.

First off, I lived through my first week on the job.
My title is QA Engineering Manager and I guess they liked me so much on my
first day that they gave me a second group to manage on Day #2.  So now
I’m overseeing two software QA teams, and I’ve got a lot to learn about the
company’s products and related technology and people and everything else!
Everyone’s great and I’m very excited and happy to be at
[Voyant](http://www.voyanttech.com/).

Last week, I upgraded my home PC called Sponge to Windows
XP.  So far, I’m very happy with it.  It hasn’t crashed once,
which is much better than Windows ME.  Unfortunately, XP wasn’t
compatible with my sound card, my tape backup drive, or my printer.
So, I bought a new sound card, took out the tape drive and am just doing
archives to a secondary hard drive, and traded printers with Beth.  Now
it’s running smoothly and everything’s happy.  Oh, I had to upgrade my
Norton SystemWorks to the latest version, too.  Version 2001 wasn’t XP
compatible for 2002 is.

I still haven’t made any progress on writing a travel log
about my vacation, but I will.  Beth and I watched a few episodes of
Sex and the City on DVD over the weekend.  It’s a famous show that
we never saw because we didn’t have HBO until recently.  It’s fairly
funny.  I can’t say it’s my favorite TV program, but it’s nice to have
a 30 minute TV show without commercials.

Yesterday (Sunday the 28th) my Ultimate Frisbee team played
our next to last game of the regular season.  We won easily against the
juniors team, made of a bunch of teenagers who are all in the same church
group.  One more game, which should be a bit tougher, and then the
tournament!

Finally, on Friday (the 26th) as I was driving home from
work, I got in the first auto accident of my whole life.  Some 16 year
old kid borrowing his brother’s sports car rear-ended me at a stop light at
Sheridan and 120th.  I didn’t call the police, thinking it would be
nice to cut the poor kid some slack, but now I’m regretting it, because he
denies responsibility for causing the accident.  Having a police report
would probably be a good thing, although I can’t imagine how the insurance
company or a court would find that I caused the accident, since I think they
almost always consider the rear-ender to be at blame over the rear-endee.
Luckily nobody was hurt.  My own suspicion is that the boy was driving
too fast for conditions, paying only marginal attention, and trying to
impress his girlfriend in the passenger seat with how fast his brother’s car
could go in rush hour traffic.  We’ll see how it goes with the
insurance investigators.
