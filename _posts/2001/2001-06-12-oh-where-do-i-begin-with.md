Oh, where do I begin
with the news?

First, the regular season for Spring League Ultimate
Frisbee is over.  My team, Adverse Reaction, won our final game of
the season.  In fact, we only won the first game and the last game,
and lost all the rest.  But I caught the winning point of the last
game!  So that made me happy.  Then we went to Wahoo’s for food
and margs.

Beth and I have volunteered to help with the Boulder
County Bat Survey again this year.  The first bat watching trip was
last night.  We’re monitoring Stearns Lake again this year.  We
only saw one bat, but I heard at least two on the bat box.  It was a
little breezy, but that didn’t seem to deter the bugs.

I bought a new musical instrument last week.  It’s
called a [Korg
Karma](http://www.korg.com/gear/info.asp?A_PROD_NO=KARMA).  It’s a synthesizer keyboard with a number of special
functions to help with improvised music.  It’s the most expensive
keyboard I’ve ever bought (even on sale) and I didn’t really budget to buy
a new keyboard this year.  So, now I’m selling off a bunch of [older
music stuff on eBay](http://members.ebay.com/aboutme/todd@toddbradley.com) in order to raise the money to make up for this
new toy.  Unfortunately, I’ve been so busy the past week that I’ve
only been able to play it for 3 or 4 hours.

Also, I upgraded our internet connection.  Since
about a year after we moved into this house, I’ve been using ISDN.
Unfortunately, it’s expensive - $75 a month for service from Qwest plus
$50 a month for my ISP.  But, since our neighborhood doesn’t have DSL
or cable internet, ISDN was my only option for a high speed
connection.  Well, now there are other alternatives.  The one I
chose is [MHO
DirectWave](http://www.mho.net/service/wireless.asp), which is a wireless broadband connection.  It
operates via a microwave dish on the roof and costs just $60 a month for
service (for 1 megabit up and down) including ISP.  So, I’ll
be saving about $65 a month and getting around 8 times the connection
speed.  What an improvement!

The weather has gotten nice enough (finally) that I’ve
resumed my glider lessons.  I took one last weekend and one the
weekend before, with one solo flight each time.  Now I need to spend
some time taking the practice exam in anticipation of getting my private
pilot’s license.

My group of [gaming
friends](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/toddsgames) is now onto a new game.  We started playing [GURPS
Traveller](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/traveller/) a few weeks ago.  I hadn’t played (or refereed)
Traveller for about 12 years, so it’s been a relearning experience for
me.  The campaign I’ve put together is called [The
Dark Wing Missions](http://www.geocities.com/darkwingmissions) and is a merchant campaign with some space opera
style drama and intrigue (eventually) thrown in.  I’m definitely
helping keep Steve Jackson in business as I’ve already bought 8 or 9 GURPS
Traveller products!

Man, that’s a lot of news!  Better make the font
smaller and move the old stuff off to the archive…
