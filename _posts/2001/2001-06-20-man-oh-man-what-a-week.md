Man oh man what a week it’s been.
On Saturday I nearly broke my ankle by stepping into an ugly hole while
running around around in the desert.  On Tuesday, I got a notice that
the check I wrote to the United States Treasury for my estimated tax payment
bounced.  So, I’ll get to pay the bounced check fees and the late tax
payment fees.  And today (Wednesday) I got laid off from my job.
What else does Lady Luck hold in store for me?
