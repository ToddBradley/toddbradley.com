Todd’s briefest restaurant review so far: [Little Anita’s](http://www.littleanitas.com/) now has a store in Broomfield, where the Burger King near Miramonte and 287 used to be. It’s a chain of New Mexican restaurants. I like the food, and they serve Mexican Coke. I don’t like that they switched to full service. For a place like this, I’d prefer to just order at a counter and save the tip.

Best item: huevos rancheros

Worst item: carnitas
