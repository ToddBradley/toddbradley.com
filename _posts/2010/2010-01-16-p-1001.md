For the past year, I’ve been working on a film called “Kung Fu Sushi Chefs.” It’s the biggest film project I’ve ever been involved with, and has a cast and crew of about 50. We did a “test shoot” to try some things out and learn from our mistakes. Now, that test shoot is a short film of its own, and it’s going to premiere on Saturday January 30 in Denver at 7:00pm. If you’re around, you should come check it out. Here is a link to the flyer:
