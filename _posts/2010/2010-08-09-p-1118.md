Habanero’s is a little Mexican quick service restaurant now located where [Tacqueria mi Barrio](http://broomfieldrestaurantreviews.com/?p=12) and Tacqueria Tamayo used to be.  I’ve been there 3 or 4 times now, and have enjoyed it every time.


They have a larger staff than before.  Although the main cook who used to work at the previous two places is still there, there’s now a boss lady and a man who works the counter.  And they’re fully bilingual, unlike the cook, who has a little difficulty in English.


The menu changed, too.  Instead of just tacos, now they serve burritos, tostadas, tortas, and a few other things.  I especially like their breakfast burritos and egg plate.  Also, if you go, be sure to try their charro beans; they’re delicious!  Each day there are typically about 3 specials.  For example, today they had menudo (it’s Saturday), fish ceviche tostadas, shrimp ceviche tostadas, and fresh made guacamole and chips.


Since the remodel, the place is definitely updated and cleaner.  And they’ve always got the big screen TV turned to Spanish language channels.  Prices for main dishes are very good, but the side dishes are a bit steep.  For example, a side of charro beans is $2.50.  You get enough for 2 or maybe 3 people, though.
