Here’s a quick one. [This assignment](http://justbento.com/handbook/bento-courses-2013/bento-101-part-2b-right-kind-bento-box-for-you):

- Go through the list you made for [Assignment 1](http://www.justbento.com/handbook/bento-courses-2013/bento-101-part-1-what-can-i-eat), and determine which kind of lunch you’re most likely to pack. Is it compact and grain-based? Do you want something hot or soupy? Maybe you prefer packing salads and sandwiches?
- Choose the type of lunch container that is the best fit for you based on your preferences.
- Now the fun part: go look for the box that’s right for you. For Japanese style bento boxes in particular, the [Where to shop](http://justbento.com/shop) page is a great place to start - it lists the wonderful bento box sellers that support this site and keep it alive and kicking. Readers in the U.S. can also try looking through the ever increasing selection of [bento boxes](http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=bento%20box&linkCode=ur2&tag=wwwmakikoitoc-20&url=search-alias%3Dgarden) on Amazon.
- If you can manage to get your bento/lunch box by next week, great! If not, try to have a backup/substitute box ready to go. We’ll be packing our very first bento for the next assignment.

My answers:

I want something flexible, that will securely hold soups or soupy foods. I measured how much food I had for lunch and it was about 1000 ml. Now granted, I usually don’t have dessert with lunch, so that estimate may be on the high side. But the bento boxes I currently have hold about 2000 ml of food, which is way more than I need. I found that the Monbento double-layer product is exactly 1000 ml, looks nice, and comes highly recommended by a couple of my friends. So I just ordered [this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HGSQEY/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) from Amazon.com.
