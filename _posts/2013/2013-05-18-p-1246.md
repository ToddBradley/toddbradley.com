I’ve narrowed it down to three possibilities. One of these three I want to buy and take to [RollerCon 2013](http://rollercon.net/) with me. But which one?

## Wig #1: Rainbow Glamorous Wig

Here’s how it looks on the model:

Here’s a simulation of how it would look on me:

## Wig #2: Multicolored Feather Wig

First, the model (which is a styrofoam dummy):

And now me:

## Wig #3: Jumbo Rainbow Clown Wig

Here’s the model. I don’t intend to dress up as a clown, though.

And here’s a simulation of how I would look with it. Sort of like a psychedelic Bob Ross if you ask me…
