The way to get into a bento habit, apparently, is to have lots of pre-made items around the kitchen. Apparently there’s even a Japanese word for this bento stash: johbisai. This week’s assignment was to make or buy one of each of three categories of johbisai:


* Something that can be ‘stashed’ in the freezer for future bentos.
* Something that can be ‘stashed’ in the refrigerator for at least a week, for future bentos.
* Something that can be ‘stashed’ in a kitchen cabinet/pantry (i.e. at room temperature) for future bentos.

So here’s what I bought or made this week for my stash


* made furikake (basic topping for rice) - Mine was ground dried toasted onions, salt, and a few other spices
* made cole slaw - red cabbage, carrots, jalapeños, apple cider vinegar, salt, and sugar
* made sho-yu tamago ([soy sauce eggs](http://justbento.com/handbook/recipe-collection-mains/sho-yu-tamago-soy-sauce-eggs))
* made teriyaki tofu
* bought tiny dill pickles
* bought grape tomatoes

I didn’t put any of these in the freezer, though. They’re all either in the fridge or the pantry. What would you freeze out of this list?
