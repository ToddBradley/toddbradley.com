Here’s a photo of Beth and me, volunteering with WRV. It’s a group we belong to that does outdoors projects related to restoring wildlands. This photo was taken during a project a couple months ago. Beth was a crew leader, and I was a cook. That meant she walked around pulling invasive weeds and showing others how to find them, and I prepared and delivered food and drinks to the work crews in the field.

I like to call this our “American Gothic” photo:
