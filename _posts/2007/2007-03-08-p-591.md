When this news…


[I. Lewis Libby Jr. News - The New York Times](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/i_lewis_libby_jr/index.html?inline=nyt-per)


…that Scooter Libby is now a proven felon was announced, Beth asked me if I thought he would be pardoned.   I said, “Of course he will.   That’s how the good old boys network works.”   She asked when it would happen.   My prediction was that it would take 18 days.   That puts us at March 24, 2007.


Anyone taking bets?
