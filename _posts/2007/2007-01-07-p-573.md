Next time you’re passing through Idaho Springs on I-70, consider stopping at Wildfire Restaurant. Beth and I had lunch there on our way to Redstone for Christmas and we were both pleasantly surprised with how good it was. The restaurant was very uncrowded, and I’m not sure why. But the food was excellent. I had a hamburger and fries that were borderline on gourmet quality. The fries were homemade, fresh, and hot. And the burger was tasty, hot, and had all the right condiments. Beth had a soup and salad and enjoyed both.

We met the owner/cook on our way out, and he’s a nice guy who said he makes all their soups from scratch, just like their french fries. We’ll definitely be back. Wildfire is right across the street from McDonald’s and next door to Starbuck’s, on the main drag through Idaho Springs near the western offramp from I-70. And apparently they have free WiFi, too!
