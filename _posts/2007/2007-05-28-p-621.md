Well, a while back, [I told you I bought Parallels Desktop](/) for my Mac. Then I said [I wasn’t too impressed](/). Well, since then some time has elapsed. And I’ve tried and failed to get some things working. But this past weekend, I had a few breakthroughs. It’s now working for me rather nicely.

I’m not 100% sure why I did it, but I set things up so I can run the following OSes in virtual machines on my laptop:

- Windows XP
- DOS 7.1
- FreeDOS
- Ubuntu Linux
