I rode my bike to work this morning for the first time of 2007.  It wasn’t too fast of a ride, partly because I was feeling lazy and didn’t want to really push it, but more importantly because most of the ride was going right into the sun and I was having a hard time seeing obstacles on the road and sidewalk.  Plus, as so often happens, the traffic was so heavy along [Zuni/Federal](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=westminster,+co&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=17&ll=39.921709,-105.014352&spn=0.005538,0.013561&t=h&om=1) that I couldn’t turn where I needed to.


But, my time this morning to work was 35:28.  That’s my new time to beat for this year, which shouldn’t be hard.


According to [this blog article]({% post_url 2006/2006-10-06-p-522 %}) from October of last year, my best time from home to work is 29:52.  So I’ve got lots of time to shave off to beat that.  But later in the year when I’m not riding right into the sunrise and feeling more like pedaling hard, I should be able to do it.  As long as nobody runs me over.
