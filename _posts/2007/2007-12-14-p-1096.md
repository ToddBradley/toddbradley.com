Taigun is my favorite sushi bar in Broomfield.  That’s not saying too much, I suppose, since we’ve only got maybe four places in the whole city to get sushi.  But hey, being first out of four is sure better than being last out of four!


Taigun is located near the FlatIron shopping mall, not far from CB & Potts.  Unfortunately, it’s not at all visible from the main street, and you have to drive way around back to find the place.  I think they changed hands a couple years ago, as the menu and staff completely changed between two of our visits.  They were awesome before, but they’re still good.


The sushi at Taigun is always pretty good and the service is polite, though often not speedy.  But I also like the rest of the menu.  They have a variety of Japanese dishes other than sushi.  I sometimes get the katsu, which is a fried cutlet with a special sauce.  They also have shumai and gyoza, which are two different types of dumplings.  We also enjoy the variety of sake they offer.  Of course, there’s the usual Japanese restaurant hot sake, but they also have some premium cold sakes.
