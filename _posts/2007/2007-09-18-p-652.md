I went to yoga class this evening, for the first time in several years. It was good; my flexibility sucks. One benefit of our annual Broomfield Parks and Rec membership is we can just drop in on any yoga, spinning, or pilates class for free anytime we want. I wonder how I’ll feel in the morning. It was a tough class, and my knee started hurting during part of it.

In other news, I’m going to Israel for two weeks in October, for work. My first time to the middle east.

At the moment, I’m listening to “The Best of Big Country.” Remember that band? I don’t own the CD, but thanks to [Simplify Media](http://simplifymedia.com/), I’m listening to it over the internet from my friend’s iTunes library. You can share your music, too. And in exchange you get access to my 34 gigabyte iTunes library. Just be my Simplify Media friend.

Last but not least, don’t you dare forget that tomorrow (Wednesday September 19) is [Talk Like a Pirate Day.](http://talklikeapirateday.com/wordpress/)
