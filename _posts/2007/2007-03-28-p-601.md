Hurray, we’re getting a tax refund!   I decided to use a professional tax preparer this year, and she added up enough deductions for us that we’re going to get a refund.   I had originally expected to have to pay a bunch of money, since I cashed out stock options but didn’t pay tax on the short term capital gains.   But I guess I had enough withholding on my W-2 to cover it.   Plus, I spent a lot of money in startup expenses for my film sound business, that I had a lot more dollars worth of deductions than expected.   That was a nice surprise!
