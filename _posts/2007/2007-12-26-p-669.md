About a year ago, I rediscovered my love of The Fixx.  Remember them?  They were sort of a new wave pop group that was big in the 80’s.  So I got their first two CDs, and have really enjoyed listening to them.  I got to wondering whatever happened to them, and found that they’ve actually more or less stayed together all these years.


Recently, I added a few more of their albums to my Amazon.com wish list.  And Beth really came through for me.  She got me 3 CDs by The Fixx for Christmas!
