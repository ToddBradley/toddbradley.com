I talked to the general manager of O’s Steak and Seafood about our [bad experience]({% post_url 2007/2007-01-20-p-583 %}) a few weeks ago.   He apologized, explained that the staff was unusually “overmatched” by the number of customers that night, and invited Beth and me back to try again at his expense.


So, last Friday, we took him up on his offer.   Beth and I both had very nice steaks, as well as salads and some wine.   The food was good, as before.   But this time it was a 180 degree turnaround with the service.   It was a much better experience, and I’d go back there again.
