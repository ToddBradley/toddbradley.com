Here’s another feature that my dream home will have:


[Wheeee!: Awesome Tube Slide Should Replace Stairs - Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/wheeee!/awesome-tube-slide-should-replace-stairs-258676.php)


Oh, you’re not aware of my plans for a dream home?   It will feature:


* photovoltaic solar
* passive solar heat and hot water
* a cistern to catch rainwater
* a partially underground main living room
* a couple of fully underground rooms
* a greenhouse
* and now…an awesome tube slide

And my plan is for it to be located [roughly here](http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=37.857507,-109.101105&spn=0.796928,1.2854&t=h&z=10&om=1).
