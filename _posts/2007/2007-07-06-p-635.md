I forgot I had this album on my iPod, but I just dialed in “[Loved Like a Milkshake](http://www.archive.org/details/Loved_Like_a_Milkshake-A_Tribute_to_Wesley_Willis)” which is the tribute album to [Wesley Willis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Willis). I’m not sure I’ve even listened to this thing before, but I’m having a really hard time concentrating on work because I’m laughing so hard. I highly recommend you download this thing (it’s free) and give it a listen. Especially if you’re a fan of Wesley Willis, but even if you’re not.
