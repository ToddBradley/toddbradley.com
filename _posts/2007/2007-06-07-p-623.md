My coworkers and I were discussing this in line at Qdoba a couple days ago. When I heard Libby had been convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison, I thought to myself, “Well, all his legal team has to do is draw the appeals process out long enough so Bush can pardon him late next year, near the end of his term.”

But an astute coworker pointed out that Bush appears to genuinely care about his “legacy” and think that history will smile upon him. And if he’s really concerned about his legacy, he won’t commit any lame duck cop-outs. We’ll see, I guess. But my money’s on Scooter getting pardoned before December 2008. Anyone want to take that bet?
