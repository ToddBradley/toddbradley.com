It’s reasonably rare that a musical group’s 2nd album is as good as their 1st. Many factors play into what’s often called the “[sophomore slump](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore_slump)” and I applaud a group that can break out of the slump and produce a 2nd album better than their 1st.

Two bands come to mind immediately: Van Halen and Iron Maiden.

Please leave a comment if you can think of another band whose second release is as good as or better than their first. I wanna hear what you have to say!

And if you want to know why Van Halen and Iron Maiden come to mind, just let me know.
