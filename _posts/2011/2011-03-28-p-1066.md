From 1996 to 2004, I led a musical group called 404 Not Found.  We self-produced and released seven CDs.  In the early days, it was just me and a collection of collaborators I met online, focused on electronic music.  Over the years, it morphed into a more traditional rock band focused on live performance of spoken word pieces set to music.  Our final show was on April 1, 2004.


Now, for the first time ever, you can download the most interesting six 404 Not Found CDs in MP3 format, for absolutely free.  Here’s what I recommend:


1. First, go check out the 404 Not Found website.  It’s kept [here](../404notfound/) in the form it existed when we split up in 2004, and were promoting our final CD, called “Paper Cuts.”  And you can go [here](../404notfound/othercds/cds/) to read about the previous albums.
2. Next, point your browser [here](../404notfound/mp3s/).  You can download each album as a ZIP file of MP3s, or you can go into each directory and select individual songs if you prefer.
3. Finally, leave me a comment to let me know what was your favorite song or your favorite album.

Enjoy!
