I just realized I haven’t written anything on my [Todd Bradley’s Galaxy](/) blog since May 22.  Wow!  Just in case you’ve been living on Planet-X and haven’t heard the news, the “12 Cities, 1 Year” project is now underway.  Since May 22, I quit my job at Polycom, sold our house, sold my motorcycle, sold our Dodge pickup, sold or gave away nearly everything we own, and set out on a year-long adventure in our Toyota Prius with Beth.


I’m writing this from Missoula, Montana, which is the 1st of the 12 cities.  And most of my writing lately has been related to our travels, adapting to major life changes, etc.  Go check that out at [the 12 Cities, 1 Year blog site](http://12cities1year.com/).
