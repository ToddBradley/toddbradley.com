I got an email out of the blue earlier this week from a guy asking if I was the author of a Cyberpunk 2020 adventure called “Live to Tell.”  The person found a copy online and wanted to include it in an archive he was building.  I wrote back that my name is indeed Todd Bradley and that I did indeed play a RPG by that name about 20 years ago.  And maybe I even wrote the adventure he’s talking about, though I couldn’t remember.  Well, he wrote back to me and sent me the adventure in PDF format.  That was enough to jog my memory.


Reading the adventure gave me a good chuckle.  It was like pulling out a 20-year-old version of me out of a time machine.  My writing style is still pretty much the same as it was then.  But the tools were pretty archaic.  I wrote the adventure in Microsoft Write (.wri) format, and drew some hokey graphics for visual aids.  The storyline sounds hilarious to the modern-day me.  I definitely wrote it keeping in mind the players in the gaming group I had at the time: hack-and-slashers with short attention spans.
