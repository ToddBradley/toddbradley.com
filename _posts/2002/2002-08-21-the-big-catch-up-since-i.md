The big catch up.  Since I
haven’t been keeping this updated, I figure there’s a lot to write about.
Here goes.

Wedding Plans.  It’s now less than two weeks
until Beth and I get married.  I thought we
had everything squared away until I realized we still have about 20 things
on the To Do list between now and then!  I won’t go into any more
detail since you can learn all about the wedding on its own page.

404 Not Found.
[The band](http://www.404notfound.net/) has been busy lately.
We did a photo shoot a while back at Lakeside Amusement Park.  We’ve
played a few gigs here and there, but not steadily, unfortunately.  I
bought a BOSS SP-505 desktop sampler, which I’ve used at a couple of
performances so far.  It’s OK for the price, but has a few
shortcomings.  You can see my thorough review of it
[here](http://www.synthsite.com/synth_reviews/boss_sp505.cfm).

Bats.  Back in July, I went on a very fun field
trip with the Colorado Bat Society.  We visited the Orient Mine in the
San Luis Valley in southern Colorado.  There, we saw the largest colony
of bats in the state.  I wrote up a pretty thorough
[photo journal](http://www.coloradobats.org/orient.htm) of my
trip.

More Photos.  I bought a digital camera this
summer.  The main reason I wanted one was to take to Hawaii with us on
our honeymoon.  But I’ve made pretty good use of it in other ways.
For instance, I took a lot of pictures of my bat trip (see above) and some
of the pre-wedding barbecue party we
had in early August.  After the honeymoon, I should have lots of
pictures to share with you.

Mini Cooper S.  Ever since March (see my March
24 journal entry below) I’ve been thinking about test driving a MINI Cooper
S.  But they apparently don’t have any available at the
[Colorado dealership](http://www.ralphschompmini.com/) yet.
I sent them an email and they never wrote back.  Lousy marketing!

Digital Video.  My band
[404 Not Found](http://www.404notfound.net/) recorded a couple of
30 minute TV segments for Denver Community Television (DCTV).  It’s a
show called Innervision TV and the sound quality was so bad on the first
one, we went back to tape another show.  Anyhow, I have videotapes of
both performances, which I bought from the host of the show.  I really
wanted to be able to show the videos to other people on the website, but I
didn’t have the equipment to digitize a VHS tape into any computer format.
After some research, I found that Mike’s Camera in Boulder will transfer VHS
to DVD for $80 an hour.  Since this was going to be just under an hour
(two half-hour shows) I thought about that for a while.  But then I
found that you can buy a USB device to grab video for anywhere between $40
and $150.  So I thought, "Why pay someone $80 to do it when I can buy
something for the same price?"  So after researching a lot of these
solutions, I bought a Pinnacle LINX.  It plugs into an RCA video and
left and right audio in one and and a USB port on the other side.  And
it comes with software to grab video.  Admittedly, it’s not full TV
resolution (640 by 480).  In fact, it’s half that, but I figured that’s
good enough, for two reasons.  First, if I want to show this online, it
has to be low res.  Second, the video is fairly crappy to begin with so
having it at lower resolution won’t hurt anything.  Anyhow, since
trying out this new device, I’ve found that it consistently locks up my PC
every time I record video using it.  Not instantly, but after an
insidious delay of anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes.  After crashing my PC
(which runs Windows XP and isn’t ever supposed to crash) a few times, the
Microsoft crash agent thingy suggested I update my video driver.  So I
got the latest NVIDIA GeForce driver and installed it.  When I did
that, then suddenly my PC would then lock up consistently within about 2
minutes of starting Windows!  Boy that’s frustrating.  So I went
back to the old video driver.  Windows doesn’t crash anymore.
Except when I try to capture video.  I wonder if I should buy a
Macintosh.  I definitely want one of the new iMacs with the big screen.

Recommendations.  I recommend reading
Interface by Stephen Bury.  That was my summertime sci fi book, I
guess.  I hope to take more fiction on my honeymoon with me, but most
of my backlog of books is nonfiction.  I’d also
recommend Paris to the Moon.  We’ve seen lots of movies this
summer, but the ones I most recommend are The Bourne Identity (maybe
just for the very strange two or three lines of non sequitur
dialogue) and Cable Guy (which I watched on DVD and was surprisingly
impressed with).  I had a dream about [Milla Jovovich](http://www.millaj.com/) last night, so I may have to rent Resident Evil.
(I’ve secretly loved Milla since Chaplin, though it
was her role in The Fifth Element that really cemented her forever in
my heart along with
[Gena Gershon](http://www.geocities.com/Paris/LeftBank/7614/gershon/gina.html) and [Madchen Amick](http://www.chez.com/madchen/).)

Finally, I just can’t get over the impression that Donald
Rumsfeld ("Mr. Secretary") looks a lot like Richard Couch ("Mr.
Bankruptcy").

Did I ever tell you the story about
[Richard Couch’s Gay Son](http://www.diablomanagement.com/Couch2.htm)?
