I’m finally selling off my old guitars. Believe it or not, I haven’t played guitar in over a year. So I pulled [these three old guitars out of the basement and put them up on ebay. It’s kinda sad to sell them, especially the acoustic guitar which my parents bought me 20 years ago. But I just don’t use them. Assuming they all sell, I’d like to use the money to buy one good quality used electric guitar, which I may use with 404 Not Found. Scott wants me to try playing guitar some.](../photos/ebayphotos/ebay/)

Well, time to go do some ironing and watch the Denver Broncos game.
