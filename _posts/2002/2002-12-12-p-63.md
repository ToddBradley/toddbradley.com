After playing some TFC with my 30+ buddies, I’m now re-scanning the photos from our wedding album. The first time I did it, it took me about 2 hours and then I found that the photos looked like crap. So this time, I’m scanning at higher resolution and saving as PNG files instead of JPG files. Wish me luck!
