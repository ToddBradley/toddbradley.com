[Yahoo! News - Bush Human Cloning ‘Deeply Troubling,’ Urges Ban](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20021227/pl_nm/health_cloning_bush_dc_1) - The White House is saying that most Americans believe human cloning is “deeply troubling.”  For what it’s worth I’m one of the [17% of Americans](http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/7782.html) who do favor human cloning experiments.  I have a pair of cousins who are clones.  Maybe that’s why I don’t get freaked out by the idea.  Their names are Donna and Debbie.
