I just finished building a few new web pages of wedding photos. It never ends! I put up photos of some of the guys getting ready before the wedding, some photos of the wedding reception, and some photos of the day after. You can find it all here: <http://www.toddbradley.com/photos/wedding/wedding_photos.htm>. I didn’t write captions for any of the photos. Do you think I should? If so, leave me a comment to that effect.
