I found out a week or two ago that the 2nd edition of Roadside Geology of Colorado is out now.  It just came out this month and updates the 1st edition which was published in 1980.  Not that the geology changes, but the roads do!  🙂


Anyhow, that’s now on my [Amazon.com wishlist](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry-edit-items-done/2I5SFQR5PJVB8/002-2760376-6050426), along with a bunch of other stuff.


Oh, last night I installed my new (used, really, but new for me) ZOOM 1204 and broke out my electric guitar for the first time in over a year.  It’s pretty dusty.  I’m thinking of selling my electric guitar, my acoustic guitar, and my electric bass guitar on eBay to try to get enough money to buy a better used electric guitar.  We’ll see how that goes.
