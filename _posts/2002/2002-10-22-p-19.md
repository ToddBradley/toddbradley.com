I’m currently reading a book that a friend and former boss recommended. It’s [How Good People Make Tough Choices: Resolving the Dilemmas of Ethical Living](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684818388/qid=1035257076/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-5011158-1248149?v=glance&n=507846). Not that I have any particular tough choices to make, but when I asked for a recommendation for a book on moral relativism, he recommended this (which isn’t on moral relativism). So far it’s easy to understand.

In the mail today was delivered a new DVD that I bought on Half.com. It’s called [Dark Days](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005NSY6/qid=1035257301/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-5011158-1248149?v=glance) and it’s an award winning documentary on homeless people in NYC who live in the subway tunnels. I read a book on this same topic once, though I can’t remember the title. Hold on and I’ll go search Amazon.com for a second. Ah, here we go. the book was [The Mole People](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556521901/ref%3Dase%5Fnewyorkcitysubwa/102-5011158-1248149). Just now, in search for that title, though, I also found [this](http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/mole-people.html) interesting site disputing much of what was written in The Mole People. And it seems there’s a [whole website](http://www.nycsubway.org/index.html) devoted to the history of the NYC subway system. Wow!

In other news, I’ve been thinking more and more of writing an essay on frozen beverages. Most people don’t appreciate them as much as I do, and I think I must be a connoisseur of them. I haven’t met too many people who can describe - or even recognize - the difference between a snow cone, Hawaiian shave ice, Slurpee, and Mr. Misty. But I can.
