Wow, it’s a new year.  There
have been only 3 things in my life the past week - planning our wedding,
working, and finishing the new [404 Not
Found](http://www.404notfound.net/) CD.  It’s done, by the way.  It’s called
[Nightmare Lullaby](http://www.404notfound.net/lullaby.htm),
after the spoken word piece of the same name by
[Scott Siders](http://www.404notfound.net/about_scott.htm).
I’ve been planning an online CD release party, and if you happen to be
reading this and have not gotten an invitation yet, please consider
joining us.
