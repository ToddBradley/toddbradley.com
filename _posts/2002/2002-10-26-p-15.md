[We](http://www.404notfound.net/) played at The Other Side arts center last night, opening for [The Voodoo Organist](http://www.voodooorganist.com/).  Attendance was much poorer than even I expected.  Whatever promotion the organizer of this show and the venue did apparently didn’t work.  I think the only people who showed up were the folks who worked there and people who heard about it through 404 Not Found.  It’s sad that 100% of the audience was there due to the opening band’s efforts, and 0% due to the people who were getting the money.  At least we didn’t sit around for 2 hours before we could go on, like the last time we played The Other Side.  Now I have to go lug all the gear in from the back of the truck, but I’m feeling lazy and will put that off until later today.


Voodoo Organist rocked, though.  Getting to see him for free counteracted my disappointment in the crowd size.  He’s got quite the act, playing and singing with bravado.  It’s just one guy (named Scott), his organ, a drum machine, and a theremin.  He used his own PA, which was smart considering the horrible time we had trying to get Christian’s to give us sound out both speakers simultaneously.  So I traded Voodoo Organist a copy of our two most recent CDs for his CD, and I bought two Voodoo Organist candles.  I felt a little sorry for the guy, trying to make a living touring and playing places like The Other Side with a single digit audience (no, I don’t mean they were gesturing with a single digit, I mean that there were fewer than 10 people there).


We were invited to a [Halloween party](http://www.conviviality.org/bscs1.htm) tonight, but I’m not sure if I’ll be in the mood or not.  I have been thinking more and more about sushi, so I think there’s a sushi dinner in store for us sometime this weekend.  Also, yesterday I got a package from Amazon.com with a book and a CD.  The book is [On-Scene Guide for Crisis Negotiators](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0849307848/102-5011158-1248149), something I’ve wanted for a while.  The CD, called [Dark Circles](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006AMVM/102-5011158-1248149), is from The Devils, mistakenly referred to on Amazon.com as just “Devils”.  They’re a group made up of Nick Rhodes and Stephen Duffy.  They were both in the original incarnation of Duran Duran in 1978, but Duffy left before they hit it big, ultimately being replaced by the infamous Simon LeBon.  The CD wasn’t cheap, since you have to buy it as an import from the UK, so I hope it’s good!  And the book wasn’t cheap either, probably since there’s not too big of a market for books on crisis negotiation.
