Holy smokes! As I’m writing this, I’m ripping my Doughty CD into MP3 files using my new do-it-all CD/DVD drive. I can’t believe how fast it is! It’s copying the data and compressing to MP3 at about 10x to 15x speed. So I just MP3-ified the entire album in less time than it took to write this blog entry - about 13 seconds per song. I should be able to crank through my backlog of CDs to rip in no time at all, now!
