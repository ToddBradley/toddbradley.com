[CDW: NEC PowerMate eco](http://www.cdw.com/shop/products/default.asp?ProductID=404772) - This is cool. I have no idea what the speed of a Transmeta Crusoe 900 MHz processor is like. But it’s nice to see an eco-friendly PC. I like the fact that it’s so quiet, due to having no fans. This could be good for a recording studio. I’d be curious about the speed of the hard drive, too, I guess. And could I use a PC with only USB ports for music recording?
