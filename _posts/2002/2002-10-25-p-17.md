Just moments after I published that last blog entry, I looked at the [reviews of this book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0399144463/customer-reviews/ref=cm_rev_all_1/102-5011158-1248149) (Who Moved My Cheese?) on Amazon.com.  Despite being a “#1 Bestseller” this book has gotten panned by those who read it and took the time to write their thoughts on Amazon.  One reviewer writes this: This book is pop-psychology for the CEO-set. Inane and ultimately confusing, the book’s ultimate “theme” doesn’t hold up to even minute philosophical scrutiny.  Boy, I can’t wait to read it now!  On the plus side, it shouldn’t take me more than about 30 minutes.  I guess I can squeeze it in during commercial breaks in this week’s Bronco’s game.
