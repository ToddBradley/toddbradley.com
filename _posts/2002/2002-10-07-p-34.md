I woke up about 3 AM this morning. Beth was…well I don’t know how to describe it other than “patting me down” all over my chest and arms. No, it wasn’t amorous in any way. It felt like a cop looking for a hidden weapon.

“What are you doing?” I asked groggily.

“Looking for my file.”

“Huh? What file?” I couldn’t figure out if she meant a manila folder type file or an emory board nail file. “And why would it be in bed?”

“Oh, nevermind.”

When we got up this morning, she had no memory of the event whatsoever.
