I feel so productive.  I just spent most of the evening editing the WAV files that make up the loops for 404 Not Found’s hit song “Spastic Colon”.  Then I imported them into the BOSS SP-505 and did some more editing and now we can actually work on doing this piece live, something which has never before been attempted!  (ooh, ahh)
