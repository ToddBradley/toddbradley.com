I’ve spent most of my spare
time in the past two weeks building a new PC.  It’s been way more of an
ordeal than I expected.  I’m not new to building homemade computers,
but this one has been one of the most challenging ever.  I wanted to
replace Sponge and Mollusk, my old Windows XP and Linux machines, with a
single top of the line machine and a hardware firewall/router.  The
whole setup finally works, but I learned some hard lessons.  Here are
the top three:

- Windows 98 will not boot if you have a CPU of 2.2 GHz
  speed or faster
- Windows 98 will not boot if you have more than 1 GB of
  RAM
- GeForce 4 video cards are incompatible with SOYO P4S
  motherboards
