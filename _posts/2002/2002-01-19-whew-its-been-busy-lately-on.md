Whew, it’s been busy lately!
On top of work (which has been hectic the past week), I went to the health
club Monday night, had the online CD release party for
[Nightmare Lullaby](http://www.404notfound.net/lullaby.htm)
on Tuesday night, a test team management workshop Wednesday night, and our
weekly Deadlands game Thursday night.  So last night (Friday) we just
stayed at home and watched [The Hurricane](http://us.imdb.com/Details?0174856) with Denzel Washington.  It was a decent show,
but nothing amazingly outstanding.  I also spent all night until nearly
1 AM working in the [recording
studio](http://www.404notfound.net/a7arl.htm).  I’m trying to get it ready for Scott and Rich to come over
this afternoon.  We’re going to plug a bunch of audio devices in
together and see what kind of noise we can generate.  Basically, this
is some experimentation and rehearsing for our first live performance, which
will be [next week](http://www.404notfound.net/performance.htm).
Later this morning, I need to go shopping and get some various gear to make
things go a little smoother in the studio.
