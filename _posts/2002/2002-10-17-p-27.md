Oh, another thing I did earlier this week was to figure out all the election issues for my area. Election day is November 5, and I’ll be in the desert hunting with my dad that day. So I’m going to do an absentee ballot for the first time ever. So I sent in my application for that and spent a couple hours Monday night reading up on all the issues and candidates and making a list of who and what to vote for. I’m now an educated and prepared voter!
