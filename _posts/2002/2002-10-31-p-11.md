Ooh, I just got email from Amazon.com saying that they’ve finally shipped my order containing [Adventures in Modern Recording](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000007VMV/102-9585010-0160942) by The Buggles.  That was their second album, which you can’t get on CD in the US.  It’s only available on the import CD from Japan, which explains why it’s $46.  You have to be a real fan of The Buggles to pay that for 9 tracks!  I hope it’s good!
