My birthday was the 20th and we
had a party.  Lots of people came and I got many nice gifts.  But
nobody bought me [one of these](http://www.miniusa.com/),
unfortunately.  I had heard they were going to make Minis for sale in
the US again, but I forgot about it until I saw a billboard along I-25 last
night that said "THE SUV BACKLASH STARTS NOW".  That’s one of their
many marketing slogans.  It was particularly interesting to me, since I
once owned the domain name suvbacklash.org and suvbacklash.com.
When I got home, I went to check out the Mini USA website and then checked
the domain registration for suvbacklash.com.  Turns out that
nobody else has picked it up since I let my registration lapse after I shut
down the site.  So, I registered it.  Again.  Maybe there is
going to be an SUV backlash after all.  Of course, you wouldn’t know it
from the actions of our Congress, who just voted to cancel the improvements
to the CAFE standards.

This past month, 404 Not Found has been rehearsing lots and
we started our [Spring
2002 performance series](http://www.404notfound.net/performance.htm).

Also, the wedding planning has been coming along.  We
now have:

- a date and time - 6 PM September 1, 2002
- a location - Boulder Theater
- an officiant - Gail Boex
- a caterer - A Spice of Life and Erika from Sushi Zanmai
- a DJ - A Music Plus
- rings - seen [here](images/rings.jpg)
- a guest list - lots of folks
- invitations - printed up and sitting in a box

And I even started a [wedding web page](/).
