There’s a [new exhibit](http://www.dmns.org/LB7/index.html) at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science that just opened yesterday.  It’s centered around the previously lost Liberty Bell 7 spacecraft.  The capsule has been sitting at the bottom of the ocean for the past 35 years and they just recently brought it up.  We’re going to check it out this afternoon.  There’s also a new IMAX movie and the exhibit about Ancient Denvers, which I want to see.  Then we’re going out for a steak dinner somewhere.  Yum!
