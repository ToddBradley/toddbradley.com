I spent way too much time yesterday delving into blogs. And the result? A whole new [SUV Backlash](../suvbacklash/suvbacklash/) site. Check it out and compare it to the [old site](../suvbacklash/oldsuvbacklash/). Things I still need to do:

- Register suvbacklash.org- Shop for someone to host the site under its own domain name - I’m pretty sure domain hosting prices have come down since I went shopping last- Start publicizing- Do a massive updating of content, including all the links and articles I’ve been saving for so long- Flesh out the separate page that shows the history of the SUV backlash- Fill out the rest of the main page and then reorganize what little navigation there is on that site- Accept donations, just in case it takes off big time
