[Yahoo! News - Scientist Claims to Produce Human Clone](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=514&u=/ap/20021227/ap_on_he_me/human_cloning_16) - Is it true or not?  Even if this one’s a hoax, as some other scientists seem to think, I’m pretty sure there will be a human clone born in the year 2003.  There’s an interesting article in the latest issue of Wired about this.  I’m also going to predict that the USA will, over the next 10 years, fall way behind the pack in terms of medical technology, due to our government’s policies against human stem cell and cloning research.  [Here’s that Wired article](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.01/cloning.html).
