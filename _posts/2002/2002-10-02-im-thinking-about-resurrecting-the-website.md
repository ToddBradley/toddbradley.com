I’m thinking about resurrecting the
[suvbacklash](http://www.suvbacklash.com/) website.  You see,
I was interviewed by a reporter for USA Today last week.  She was
writing this article about the SUV backlash (though she didn’t use that term
exactly) and wanted some extra background material.  None of my
interview was used in the article, but the article did turn me on to the
fact that there’s more activity on the anti-SUV front than I was aware of.
I thought for a few moments about building it as a Manila site, but now I’m
thinking that if I do resurrect it, I’ll just keep it in FrontPage.  In
other news, I’ve developed an interest in learning more about ethical
relativism.  I’ve been reading on the web about it some, but have
failed to find a really good book that surveys arguments for and against.
