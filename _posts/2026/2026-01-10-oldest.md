Since I've got all 25+ years of my blog restored, I thought it would be amusing to see what the oldest post is. I'm sure it's something inane, like "hey, I made a blog!" Let's see...

It turns out the oldest post is [this journal entry from Summer 2000]({% post_url 2000/2000-06-01-well-im-learning-to-soar-you %}).

It's hard for me to believe this is the absolute first, but it must have been one of the first. Right about that time, I had started a job at a "dot com" software company in Denver. I lived in Broomfield. And I was learning to fly sailplanes in Boulder. I eventually did my first solo flight in December 2000. However, before I could take the exam for my license, I got laid off from the dot com (Jabber.com it was called, later sold to Cisco, and who knows who owns them now). So since I didn't have a job, I had to quit expensive hobbies, and soaring was one of them.

Here's the Polaroid photo my instructor took after my first solo flight on December 7, 2000.

Here's something funny about that old post. I was still double spacing between sentences, like I had learned in high school typing class. A few years later, I shook that habit.
