Man oh man, it's been so long since I wrote a blog post. I have so much to say and I'm not sure where to even start. This website - my personal blog called Todd Bradley's Galaxy - was dead all of 2025. I was doing some technical maintenance, and I broke things bad. But now, after months of work and hundreds of dollars of "AI" rental, it's back.

It was a WordPress site, and now it's a Jekyll site, much much faster and less expensive to operate. But more on that in a separate blog post.

Did you know my blog has been online since the year 2000? Yeah, it's 25 years old. How many websites do you use that have lived to see their 25th birthday?

Anyhow, Brooke and I are doing fine. I have a year's worth of news to catch you up on. But for now, hello and welcome!
