I don’t have much to say, but I did learn to make two new cocktails this weekend. For the first time, I made a Negroni and a Sazerac last night. They were good. I think I liked the Negroni more. I’ve had both at bars or restaurants, but never had the ingredients or inclination to make them at home.
