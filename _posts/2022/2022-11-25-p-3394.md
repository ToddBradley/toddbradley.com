I haven’t been writing on my blog very much lately, and when I do it seems like it’s just about food and drink. Well, here’s another food related post! Yesterday was Thanksgiving. Brooke and I stayed in Denver and had a quiet Thanksgiving meal at home. She did the cleaning, as usual, and I did the shopping, cooking, prepping, and most of the bartending.


This year, I think I hit the perfect mix of pre-prepared food and cooking from scratch. We had a wonderful feast, but I didn’t feel like I spent hours in the kitchen making it all. Here’s my menu:



## Breakfast

* cinnamon rolls [from Frank Bonanno’s Drive Thru Pie Pop Up on the sidewalk of Luca, a couple blocks from here]
* lattes [almond milk for Brooke and skim milk for me]


## Appetizers

* jicama sticks and spinach dip [thanks to Trader Joe’s]
* almonds [nothing special here]
* pickled green beans [I found these at a Christmas market a few weeks ago, and they were yummy]


## Main Course

* smoked turkey breast [from [Post Oak BBQ](https://www.postoakdenver.com/) in north Denver]
* garlic mashed potatoes [same]
* brisket gravy [same]
* collard greens [same]
* turkey sausage stuffing fried rice [came frozen from [Trader Joe’s](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/turkey-sausage-stuffing-fried-rice-071810)]
* glazed carrots [made from scratch, [traditional recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/229669/glazed-carrots/) plus a special ingredient - Chinese Five Spice blend]


## Desserts

* pecan pie [from [Project Angel Heart](https://www.projectangelheart.org/), proceeds go to charity]
* apple pie [same]
* assorted Thanksgiving cookies [from [Maggie & Mollie’s](https://maggieandmollys.com/)]
