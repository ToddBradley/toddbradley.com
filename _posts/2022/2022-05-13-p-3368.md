I saw a delicious photo online the other day. It was some chile colorado that a professional chef made, and it looked wonderful. So I decided to make some of my own. Here’s my recipe. It requires an InstantPot and a strainer and a blender.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound beef chuck roast stew meat
- 15 dried pasilla chiles
- 1 T Better Than Bouillon Beef Base
- 5 peeled garlic cloves
- 1 tsp coconut oil
- 1 T cornstarch
- cumin
- Mexican oregano
- rosemary
- salt
- pepper

## Instructions

1. Remove seeds and stems from the dried pasilla chiles, and throw them in the InstantPot.
2. Add a quart of water, the Better than Bouillon, and the garlic.
3. Pressure cook for 30 minutes.
4. Pour all this into a blender and liquefy it.
5. Strain the results into another pot. You don’t want any seeds or big chunks of chile flesh or garlic.
6. Now that your InstantPot is empty, use it on Saute mode to thoroughly brown the stew meat in the coconut oil.
7. Pour the strained chile sauce into the pot, and add salt, pepper, Mexican oregano, rosemary, and cumin to taste.
8. Bring this all to a boil, then put on a non-sealing lid and slow cook it for 24 hours. Yes, a full day. This is going to break down all the connective tissue in the beef and make it so soft it falls apart. That connective tissue then mixes with the chile water to make a very rich sauce.
9. Switch the InstantPot back to Saute mode.
10. Add more spices to taste, if needed. Then use cornstarch to thicken the sauce.
11. Serve in bowls. Enjoy with a big spoon, and optionally some corn chips
