I think the last time I got a certification of some kind that wasn’t related to my job was when I took (and passed) a Wilderness First Aid course in Boulder about ten years ago. Well, here’s another.


I just finished a week long Intro to Espresso course. Come on over if you’d like a cup.

Oh, I guess I forgot to mention that I recently made a massive upgrade to my home coffee setup. I bought a German espresso machine, and an unusually good electric grinder. These are both a big step up from the manual grinder and espresso maker I had been using. And my shots are a lot easier and more consistent now. Here I am posing with the thing after I got it all assembled.

I guess I should update [this post about my coffee setup]({% post_url 2022/2022-03-31-p-3359 %}) sometime.
