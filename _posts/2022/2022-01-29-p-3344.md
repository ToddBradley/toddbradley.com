If you haven’t already read it, this is a continuation of [Native Chopped, Part 1]({% post_url 2022/2022-01-24-p-3324 %}). Go catch up if you need to.

The live event happened as planned, on January 27, 2022. One of the five contestants that started the competition with us was replaced, for reasons they never explained. But they got another volunteer to fill in. So there were five cooks total.

How did I do? Well, I didn’t win. In fact, based on the photos and descriptions of the other four contestants’ entries, I’d say they all did better than me. There wasn’t a last place prize, but if there was, I feel like I should’ve gotten it. But hey, this was my first time doing something like this, plus I had COVID at the time and was pretty low on energy and creativity.

If you didn’t watch live, you can go check out the recording on YouTube, right here:

Here’s a screenshot of my part of the presentation. Recognize these two food photos from the previous post? And the speaker with the grey beard?

All in all, it was a fun experience, and I very much appreciate the huge pantry box of food they gave me for playing. Stay tuned for photos of blue corn mush!
