I’ve been on a roll of sharing cocktail recipes, but here’s something non-alcoholic. It’s an espresso tonic. I made this the easy way, after abandoning a James Hoffman video halfway through. No, I’m not going to make my own tonic syrup.

my espresso tonic
Ingredients:


* 4 ounces tonic water - Run-of-the-mill tonic water isn’t good enough for James, but it’s good enough for me. I just used 365 brand from Whole Foods.
* 2 ounces of fresh but cooled espresso
* 1 wedge of orange
* 1 Luxardo cherry
* 1 cup of ice

Make the espresso, then let it chill in the fridge for a while. Fill a glass with ice, and pour in a half cup of tonic water. Then pour the espresso over the top. Add orange wedge and cherry. Enjoy.
