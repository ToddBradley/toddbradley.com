I’ve thought for a while I might be able to make a satisfying breakfast sausage at home that used all “zero-point” ingredients according to Weight Watchers. And today I finally did it. Here’s my recipe. I’m eating it as I type, so forgive any typos. It’s pretty tasty.

### Ingredients

- 1 pound ground turkey breast (“ground turkey” isn’t a zero-point food on Weight Watchers, but “ground turkey breast” is)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp sage
- 1 tsp thyme
- 1/2 tsp marjoram
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes

### Directions

- Heat up a pan to medium heat.
- Put all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and knead it with your hands until the spices are integrated with the ground turkey breast.
- Spray some cooking spray into the pan.
- Shape little patties toss them in the pan. Alternatively, if you’re lazy like me, just grab a patty-size amount of the meat mix, throw it in the pan, and then squish it flat with a spatula.
- Give a quick dash of cooking spray to the top of the patties, and then flip. Cook until there’s no more pink, or until they’re brown enough on both sides. Use a meat thermometer if you don’t trust yourself to eyeball when ground turkey is done cooking.

Using my big fry pan, this recipe makes about one and a half pans worth of sausage patties, around 10.

Eat with scrambled eggs, fruit, and a cappuccino, or whatever else you like for breakfast.

Variation: As written, the sausage is fairly mild and will probably appeal to everyone. But if you want to liven it up a little, use more black pepper and more red pepper flakes.

Thanks to “mechanicmike” who wrote [this original recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/229989/turkey-breakfast-sausage/). I just made it healthier by removing the sugar and fat and increasing the amount of spices.
