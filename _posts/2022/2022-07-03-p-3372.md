Time for another alcoholic drink I invented. I’m sure I can’t be the first to mix these things, but let’s just pretend it’s true. It’s summer, and that means light and fruity drinks. I bought a bunch of fresh mint at the farmers market, and decided it might go well with the [Colorado Cider Company](https://coloradocider.com/our-cider/) Cherry Glider I’ve been saving for a special occasion. I was right. The cider is a blend of (hard) apple cider from Colorado and cherries. And I love cherries!

Recipe:6 ounces Cherry Glider Cider1 ounce rye whiskey1 handful of fresh mint


Muddle the mint with the whiskey to release the minty deliciousness. Add the cider, and lots of ice. Muddle it some more. Abuse that ice!


Then, sip and enjoy. Since a can of cider has 12 ounces, that’s a perfect invitation to have two of these fine drinks. That’s good because after one, I really wanted a second.
