The company I work for is celebrating its 190th birthday this year. I don’t think I’ve ever worked for a company that existed more than 50 years. So 190 is weird to me. Think about what was going on in 1834, the year Wärtsilä was founded.The Spanish Inquisition ended. The city of Toronto was founded. Andrew Jackson was president of the US. The Whig party came to be.Here’s a video they made about what the company has accomplished, mostly in the 189 years when I wasn’t an employee.
