My Apple Watch freaked out this morning. When I turned off my alarm after waking up, it spontaneously started flashing random apps on the screen, then called 911 and texted my GPS coordinates to Brooke and my sister-in-law Rachel to tell them I was having an emergency. I wondered if I had been hacked.

And it resulted in Brooke’s coffee being 10 minutes late, she wants me to add.

After calling 911 back to tell them I wasn’t having an emergency, I contacted Apple tech support. The person there took my information and told me I should update to the latest watch OS. I asked if this was a known bug, and she denied it. But then I found this article that describes exactly what happened, and that it has - hopefully - been fixed in software version 10.4.
