Here’s an example of the kind of messages I get these days from technical recruiters:



Urgent requirement for Factory Automation Engineer at Waterloo, Iowa


From: Mohit Kumar


Factory Automation Engineer at Waterloo, Iowa Variable shifts (Off shift) - Onsite W2 Contract 1 Year to start with possible extensionCall @ 734 656-8818 Or Resume @ robert@Infotreeglobal.com



There are still some respectable recruiters out there. But 99% of them are just one step removed from Nigerian prince scammers.
