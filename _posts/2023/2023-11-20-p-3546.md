This isn’t the answer I was expecting, but I appreciate the honesty to say “don’t bother reporting bugs to us, we aren’t interested in fixing them.”

Hi, are you interested in bug reports from users? I keep running into the same bug in your app related to group orders, and have heard from a friend that he’s run into it also. I’m a pretty senior software developer, so I know how to trace and reproduce software bugs pretty well. But I also know that frankly some organizations don’t really care because they don’t address bugs reported by users anyhow. That’s why I’m asking up front.

Let me know. Thanks,Todd Bradley
