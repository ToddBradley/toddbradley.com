I finally finished uploading my video “Inside Todd’s Head” to YouTube. Here it is in normal (low) quality:

And here is the higher quality (HD) version:

I realize 95% of people are going to watch this video and listen to it through low quality computer speakers, and those people will miss out on 95% of the point of this video, sadly. If you want to hear what my best representation of how SCDS really sounded in my case (before surgery) you’ll need to put on headphones.
