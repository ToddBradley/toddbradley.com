[I just read](http://consumerist.com/5139480/monstercom-hacked-user-names--passwords-stolen) that Monster.com had a major security breach, and crackers stole not only basic personal info of users but their passwords as well.  So, if you’re like me, and used the same password on Monster.com as on other websites, your login on those other sites is now at risk.


I just canceled my Monster.com membership over this, but the damage has already been done.
