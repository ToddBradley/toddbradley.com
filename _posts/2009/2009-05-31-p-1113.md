I just read this from the Broomfield Enterprise:

> Herb’s Meat and Specialty Foods, which has been a Boulder fixture since 1976, will relocate to the Depot Hill Shopping Center at the corner of U.S. 287 and 10th Avenue. High rents and a shifting customer base are forcing the independently owned butcher out of its longtime home.

Woo hoo! A real butcher shop within walking distance of my house. Now if we could just get an independent owned coffee shop and a real bakery in the same area…
