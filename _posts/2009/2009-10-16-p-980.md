[Interracial couple denied marriage license in La. - Yahoo News](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091016/ap_on_re_us/us_interracial_rebuff)
“A white Louisiana justice of the peace said he refused to issue a marriage license to an interracial couple out of concern for any children the couple might have.”

The couple live in Hammond, Louisiana, which is where I had my major ear surgery back in January. The hospital sure was nice, I can say that.

Anyone want to guess how this issue will turn out? Think the judge will be fired? Or not re-elected? Or whatever they do to bad judges in Louisiana?
