In Broomfield, everyone is getting their “2009 Real Property Notice of Valuation” letters last week and this week. Folks are in an uproar because the county is assessing property so high, when property values are actually going down. Some say it’s an intentional act on the part of the Broomfield government to drive up property taxes, given that sales tax revenues are down due to the crappy economy.

HOWEVER, I just looked at our letter, and the county is saying our property did in fact decrease in value over the past two years. According to their letter, our house lost $19,000 in value since the last assessment. So how come ours went down so much when everyone else is complaining about their going up?
