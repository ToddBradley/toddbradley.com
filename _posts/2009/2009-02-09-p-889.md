Next week, I must return to Baton Rouge for my 6 week follow-up on my ear surgery.  If I can work up sufficient appetite I plan to go out that evening to Brunet’s Cajun Restaurant and attempt to tackle…bom bom bom…the dreaded shrimp dinner.


What’s included in the shrimp dinner, you ask?  Well, here’s an excerpt from the menu (in both English and French, of course):


> Shrimp Dinner  ……………………………………….. 20.99
Diner d’ Chevrette
Includes cup of gumbo, shrimp salad, shrimp etouffee, fried shrimp, shrimp au gratin, boiled shrimp, spiced shrimp, stuffed shrimp. Served with french fries or baked potato, and french bread.
Continer du gombo, un salade aux chevrette, etouffee d’chevrette, chevrette frits, au gratin du chevrette, chevrette bouilli, chevrette bien assaissone, chevrette bourree. Servir avec des pomme de terre frits ou cuire or founeau, et du pain francais.


Reminds me of the scene in “Forrest Gump” where Bubba lists all the ways to prepare shrimp.  Bubba would’ve loved Brunet’s Shrimp Dinner, I think.
