## [Humans Originated Near Current Border of Angola and Namibia]({% post_url 2009/2009-05-05-p-924 %})

Thanks to modern genetic research, we’ve known for a while that humans all descended from the same stock (”Mitochondrial Eve” is our common female ancestor) somewhere in Africa. Yes, all of us white folks are the result of a genetic mutation that happened some time later, contrary to what a lot of white supremacists and Christian artists would like you to believe.

But now the new chapter in the story is that they’ve been able to pinpoint with pretty good certainty the region of Africa where our common ancestors came from. Here’s a Boing Boing summary of an interesting (and short) New York Times article:

> Snip from a NYT article about a new study by a group of geneticists which pins the origin of humankind to a spot on the coast of southwest Africa near the Kalahari Desert.

   That doesn’t look at all like the place where all the Battlestar Galacticans ended up. It must be wrong.

   Remember, they dropped Hera off something like 50,000 years ago. The landscape changed a lot in the meantime. Just imagine what Denver looked like 50,000 years ago!
