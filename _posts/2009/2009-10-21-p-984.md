A moment of reverent silence, please, for the passing of Joseph Wiseman.  He played the Bond villain in the very first James Bond movie, “Dr. No”.  A coworker and I were just talking about that character earlier this week.  He didn’t get all the cool evil lines that later villains got, but he started it all.
