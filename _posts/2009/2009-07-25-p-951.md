I was just flipping through channels on TV last night and ran into “Hell in the Pacific.” I thought I’d watch just a few minutes, but I got sucked into it and watched the whole thing. It’s a weird movie. There are really only two characters in it. Toshiro Mifune (widely regarded as the best Japanese film actor ever) was in it, and only spoke Japanese. His counterpart was played by Lee Marvin, who only spoke English. Can you think of any other film with only two characters who speak different languages throughout?

Mifune was such an incredibly amazing actor. You may know he was Akira Kurasawa’s main actor, and he made - according to IMDB - 181 films. He appeared in such classics as “The Hidden Fortress” and “Yojimbo” and “The Seven Samurai.”
