Here is some much-needed GOOD NEWS from the War on Terror:

> After a long two days of legislative battle, the House Judiciary Committee just finished its second day of debate on Chairman Conyers’ PATRIOT reform bill, [HR 3845](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-3845) (see our wrap-up of the [first day](http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/11/house-committee-considers)). Thanks in no small part to those of you who used our [action alert](https://secure.eff.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=443), the Committee rejected almost all amendments that would have weakened the bill’s reforms and voted to recommend the bill to the House floor by a vote of 16 to 10.
> Even better, the Committee kept going after it was finished with PATRIOT to consider Representative Nadler’s State Secret Protection Act ([HR 984](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-984)), which would [reform the state secrets privilege](http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/11/congress-considers-state-secrets-reform-obama-admi) that the government has repeatedly used to try and throw EFF’s [warrantless wiretapping cases](http://www.eff.org/issues/nsa-spying) out of court. After an impassioned defense by Mr. Nadler, who described how the government has used the privilege like a “magic incantation” to cover-up wrongdoing and warned that state secrecy “is the greatest threat to liberty at present,” the bill passed with even better numbers than the PATRIOT bill, 18 to 12!
