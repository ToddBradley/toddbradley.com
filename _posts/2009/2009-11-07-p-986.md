I’ve seen a lot of Hong Kong action movies.  Certainly not as many as the very dedicated fans, but way more than 99% of the American population.  This segment from an action scene in a film with the English title “A Chinese Torture Chamber” takes “action” in a whole new direction.


Warning: You are probably not going to enjoy this unless you (a) know and appreciate the traditions of Hong Kong action cinema and (b) are not averse to explicit sex scenes.


Now, with that warning out of the way, [go check out this clip](http://jdsmanstories.net/?p=1053).  Here is the [IMDB page](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113757/) about the film, for completeness.
