## 



I went for a short bike ride yesterday and it left me unsatisfied.  So, I wanted to go for a longer ride today.  Plus, I needed to go to the office to get a couple hours of work done.  I ended up combining the two and rode to Voyant and back, which was the longest bike ride I’ve had in over 10 years.  It came out to 13.27 miles, which probably doesn’t seem like much for regular bike riders, but was plenty long for me!


These evening, I brought home some dinner from Taco Bell, and Beth and I watched “Hedwig and the Angry Inch.”


Tomorrow, I fly to Washington.
