I’m impressed.  The MoveMe software worked quite well.  I apparently moved all my applications and data files over to my new PC.  In fact, it moved some apps over that I thought I got rid of long, long ago!  It got about 80% of the apps right, with the other 20% needing some manual repair (uninstalling and re-installing).  But overall, this saved me quite a bit of time.  Hurray!
