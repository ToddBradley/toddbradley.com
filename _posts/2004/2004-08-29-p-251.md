This Wednesday is our 2nd wedding anniversary. Maybe I’ll take a photo of us to compare to how we looked on our [wedding day](/). You see, I finally bought a new digital camera (an [Olympus D-560](http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_product_lobbypage.asp?l=1&p=16&bc=1&product=912)) a couple weeks ago, to replace the one that was destroyed in the San Juan River in June 2003.

Speaking of which, I have a few photos I’ve taken with my new camera that I should upload. Some are from one of the rehearsals of the Convivial Seuss theater performance I was involved in, and some are action photos of my 2004 Summer League Ultimate Frisbee team.

And on the subject of theater, I’ve volunteered to help out a local theater group called [The Upstart Crow](http://www.serve.com/upstart/). This afternoon, we’re moving all our stuff into the theater for the next performance, called “The Trojan Women.” I’ll be running lights, something I’ve never done before. But I thought it would be a fun, educational experience for me.

This past week, I was in [Pleasanton, California](http://www.ci.pleasanton.ca.us/index_full.html) for management training at [my company](http://www.polycom.com/home/)’s headquarters.
