Wow, it’s already the 12th and this is my first blog entry of 2004. It’s Monday night and Beth and I just got back from a 4 day weekend in Washington, D.C. We went there to visit our friend Sybil and do some sightseeing. We went to the Holocaust Memorial Museum on Saturday and the Udvar-Hazy Center (that’s the new expansion of the National Air and Space Museum that’s out by Dulles airport) on Sunday. My knee was put to the test and did about as I expected, which was a fair amount of pain. Lots of walking and standing. Of course, we spent way more money than we should’ve, but the airline tickets were free (from frequent flyer miles) and I found a really good deal on a hotel (the One Washington Circle Hotel, which is a very quaint boutique all-suite hotel right across the street from the hospital - so it was very nicely furnished and had sirens blaring outside our window all night long).
