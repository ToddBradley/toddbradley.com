## [Project / Object]({% post_url 2004/2004-10-27-p-287 %})



Beth and I went to see a band called [Project / Object](http://projectobject.com/) last night.  They were playing at [Cervantes Masterpiece Ballroom](http://www.cervantesmasterpiece.com/) in Denver.  I’d never been there and I’d never seen Project / Object (though I’ve been on their email list for a couple years).  They’re mainly a Frank Zappa tribute band.


There was an opening act called “Me Myself I” which was a one-man performance from this guy who had a loop machine and several instruments.  He’d play 8 bars on one instrument (guitar, say) and then loop that over and over while he played another instrument (bass, for instance) over the top of it.  Then, he’d record them together, and let that loop continue while he played another instrument.  It was mildly entertaining.


Project / Object was playing with Ike Willis, whom I’d seen before when he played in Boulder as part of Banned from Utopia.  It was good to see him again, and the Project / Object crew were pretty darn good.  The sound quality wasn’t great, sadly, and Beth had a hard time understanding any of the words to the songs.  Since they were almost all Zappa tunes, I already knew the words, so I could make out what they were saying.  We had to leave after their first set was done, though, because it was about 11:30 by then and I had to get up to go to work this morning.  I bought Project / Object’s 2 CDs on the way out the door.  I’ll give them a listen today.


Tonight we’re planning to go to [The Dig](http://www.denverdig.com/TheDig/ParkSpoof/Entry.asp).
