[Looks Like I’m Going Nowhere!](http://www.lookslikeimgoingnowhere.com/) - Here’s the start of yet another website. I’ve been setting my home Linux PC up to have external access to ssh, ftp, http, and mail. So I decided to give it its own domain name. So far, I’m most proud of the drawing that serves as the front page. If you click that, it just takes you to a TWiki website without much content yet.
