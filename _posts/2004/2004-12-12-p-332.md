## [More Akumal Photos]({% post_url 2004/2004-12-12-p-332 %})

I finally scanned the photos I took on our Thanksgiving snorkeling trip to Yal Ku Lagoon, and added those to my Akumal photos page. There are some of my first underwater photos there. Most of them came out really crappy, but here are the best of them.
