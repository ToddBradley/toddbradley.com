## [Merry Christmas to me]({% post_url 2004/2004-12-13-p-330 %})



Well, I went on a nice shopping spree this afternoon and bought myself several related Christmas gifts.  I got a Martin guitar ([model 000CXEBLACK](http://www.martinguitar.com/guitars/choosing/guitars.php?p=c&g=9&m=000CXEBLACK)), a case, a [Behringer Ultracoustic ACX1000](http://www.behringer.com/ACX1000/index.cfm?lang=ENG) amplifier, a [KORG GT-3](http://korg.com/gear/info.asp?A_PROD_NO=GT3) guitar tuner, a strap, a couple sets of strings, and a book of Christmas music for guitar.


Here’s what the guitar looks like:
