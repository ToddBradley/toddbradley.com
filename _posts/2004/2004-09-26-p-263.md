[CBBC Newsround | WORLD | Siberian boy, 7, raised by dogs](http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/world/newsid_3539000/3539482.stm) - I didn’t believe this when I first read it on another web page, but it looks like the BBC is reporting the same story.  I’m more inclined to believe what I read from the BBC, compared to [Onlypunjab.com](http://www.onlypunjab.com/real/fullstory-newsID-2203.html).  Bizarre, eh?
