[The New York Times > Washington > Red Cross Finds Detainee Abuse in Guantanamo](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/30/politics/30gitmo.html?oref=login&th) - What? You’re telling me that not only have we held these prisoners without legal representation, a statement of charges, or concern for the Geneva Convention, but that we’ve been torturing them for the past 3 years, too? What a surprise!

And the GW Bush administration has just received a “mandate” from the US citizens, which must mean this is how the American people want it. I sure am glad I’m not in the military, because I doubt any American POW is going to ever be treated humanely again, now that the world knows how we’ve been treating others.
