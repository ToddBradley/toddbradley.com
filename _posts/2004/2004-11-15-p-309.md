## [What has changed with Colin Powell?]({% post_url 2004/2004-11-15-p-309 %})

In August of 2003, there were [rumors that Colin Powell wouldn’t stick around](http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/08/04/powell.2nd.term/) for Bush’s 2nd term. He squashed those rumors by saying, “I serve at the pleasure of the president.”

Now, 15 months later, he [has resigned, stating](http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/11/15/powell/index.html), “It has always been my intention that I would serve one term.”

So, what happened in the past 15 months?
