I finally was able to go for a bike ride today. The weather was warm enough and the wind died down somewhat (10 to 15 mph, down from 30 mph) from yesterday, so I took my new bike out for a spin. I went to the local library and back. Coming back was a lot tougher, since it’s all uphill and against the wind. Even though it was only a few miles, I felt like I had a good workout.

I took my GPS receiver along, just for grins, partially because that’s the only way I could tell for sure how far I’d travelled. You see, I bought a bike computer (with odometer function) but the wire that connects the magnetic pickup to the display isn’t long enough for a Revive bike. So then I bought a wireless model, and found that the radio doesn’t have the range to go from my little from wheel all the way up to the handlebars. How frustrating! So it may be that GPS is the only way for me to get a real sense of how far I’ve traveled.
