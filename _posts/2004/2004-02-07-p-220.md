[Kakushi toride no san akunin (1958)](http://imdb.com/title/tt0051808/) - I TiVo’d “The Hidden Fortress”, which is a Japanese film from 1958 by the famous director Akira Kurosawa.  I finally finished watching the thing last night.  I’d read for years that this was, in some way, the inspiration for “Star Wars”.  But having seen “Star Wars” enough times that I can almost recite the dialog from every scene, I have to say that the parallels between the two films are very sparse.
