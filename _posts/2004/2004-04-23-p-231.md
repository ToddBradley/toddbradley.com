I just got to work about 20 minutes ago. I was at the ear doctor this morning. The tests from last week have shown that I have an abnormal buildup of fluid pressure (called “endolymphatic hydrops”) in my right inner ear. The test isn’t 100% accurate, though. So, to test the theory that this ear pressure is the source of my problems, I’m going to start a special regime for the next 6 weeks. I must reduce or eliminate caffeine, go to a low sodium diet (limit to 2000 mg per day), and take diuretic pills. This should reduce the fluid level, and possibly fix my autophony problems. If it doesn’t, well, I don’t know what the next step would be.
