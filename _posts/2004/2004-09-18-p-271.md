I downloaded and installed the [Firefox 1.0](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) “Preview Release” which just came out this week. So far, I don’t really see any reason to switch to Firefox over [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/). What’s the big draw of this browser?

My [ChoiceMail](http://www.digiportal.com/) Spam-O-Meter is now at 86%. It has prevented 16614 spam messages from getting to my inbox since I started using it.

Next, I’m going to install and try out [Netobjects Fusion 8.0](http://netobjects.com/index.html). I got that free for signing up with my new webhost. I figured since it’s free, I might as well check it out and see if it’s any better than MS FrontPage. So far, just from reading the “Getting Started” booklet they sent, I’m afraid the answer may be “no”.
