[Wired News: Scientists Pin Date on L.A. Quake](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,63097,00.html) - I was lying in bed this morning in my hotel room in Pleasanton, CA, thinking about driving back across the San Francisco Bay on the Hayward Bridge. And then I remembered this Wired article I read about 6 months ago. These people predicted a 6.4 earthquake in Southern California (not Northern, where I am right now) by September 5. Well, it hasn’t happened yet. And there’s just one week left!
