[Gizmodo : Polycom ViaVideo II](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/polycom-viavideo-ii-024591.php) - Looks like something my company makes was actually mentioned on Gizmodo. Of course, I have nothing to do with this product, but I suppose it’s nice to see my company’s name mentioned on such a prestigious website.
