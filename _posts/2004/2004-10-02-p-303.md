## [snap to grid software]({% post_url 2004/2004-10-02-p-303 %})



You know what I want for my Windows XP PC?  I want some software that I can run and it’ll make other applications’ windows snap to a grid on the desktop.  In other words, I want it to be that when I resize the window for any program, it’ll only resize in increments of N pixels, where N is configurable to be 60 or 100 or whatever.  That way, I can lay out programs more precisely on my desktop.
