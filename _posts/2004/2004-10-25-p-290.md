## [Spanish Immersion Weekend]({% post_url 2004/2004-10-25-p-290 %})



Beth and I have had a very busy October.  Three weekends in a row, we had all-weekend plans.  First we were out of town to visit my parents, then we had our scuba training.  Well, this past weekend was the end of the busy-ness, and was a “[Spanish Immersion Weekend](http://www.freeu.com/classes/spanish/immersion_new.html).”  That’s a program that [Colorado Free University](http://www.freeu.com/) puts together to try to really improve people’s Spanish skills in a short amount of time.  We had stuff Friday night, all day Saturday from about 8:30 AM to 9:00 PM, and then Sunday from 10:00 to 1:30.  We celebrated finishing the whole thing by going out for dim sum Sunday afternoon.  And boy was I glad to be speaking English the rest of the day.


I do have to say that the immersion approach sure speeds along comprehension.  It had been 3 years since we took a Spanish class, and by the end of the weekend, I was starting to understand quite a bit that the instructors were saying without having to translate it to English in my head.  I probably spoke 2x as much Spanish over the weekend as English.
