I got this email this past week:

>

> Hello,
> I was looking for information on replacing my SUV (a 1996 Ford Explorer)
> with a Segway iSeries since I’m taking a sabatical from my job to return
> to school full-time and complete my degree in Engineering.
> The Olentangy Bikeway is about a mile and a half from my apartment, so I
> plan to use that for my commute to campus. If you know anyone who might
> be willing to chip in and help me accomplish this goal, could you please
> direct them to my donation page?
> [http://www.marknoble.com/content/suv-to-segway/suv-to-segway.aspx](http://www.marknoble.com/content/suv-to-segway/suv-to-segway.aspx)
> It will get an SUV off the road for two years - and since it will be in
> a garage during that time nobody else will be driving it (as opposed to
> cases where people sell their SUV’s for others to drive).
> Thanks,
> Mark
