[Bloomberg.com: Top Worldwide](http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&sid=afkpEnqQLHwk&refer=top_world_news): “The July 12-15 Marist poll put the so-called undecideds among U.S. registered voters at 9 percent and found that 7 percent of those leaning toward one candidate might switch.” - Aha, a fact. So, 9% of voters are undecided, as of a couple weeks ago. That’s actually more than I expected. I don’t think I know of anyone who’s undecided.
