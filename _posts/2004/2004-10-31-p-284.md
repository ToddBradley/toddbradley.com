## [Mozilla -> Firefox]({% post_url 2004/2004-10-31-p-284 %})

I’ve completed the switch from Mozilla 1.7 to Firefox 1.0 (release candidate). I’m now using Firefox at both work and home (though my home laptop uses Mozilla still). I had to install Thunderbird, which is Firefox’s mail/news reader. It looks and acts just like the one built into Mozilla, so learning curve is nil.
