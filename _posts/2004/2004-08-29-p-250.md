I’m talking about my former website, called “SUV Backlash.” It’s now defunct. I never did have the time to fully flesh it out like I wanted to, and many of the pages I had up there were out of date. So I blew away everything except for my basic story. I’ve got the domain name until March 2005. If anyone else wants it, let me know.
