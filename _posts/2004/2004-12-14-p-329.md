[BBC NEWS | Europe | Dutch consider infant euthanasia](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4093965.stm) - According to this article, 72% of pediatricians in the Netherlands (and 74% in France) are in favor of “ending the lives of newborns in certain circumstances.” I wonder what the numbers would be in the US. I remember writing a research paper in high school English class about euthanasia. I was then - and still am - of the belief that it’s appropriate and acceptable in some circumstances.

For instance, if a baby is born without a brain (the example the article gives) I think it’s unnatural and wrong to use technology to keep the infant alive. Similarly, I told Beth that if the time comes when I have senile dementia to the point of not knowing who I am or who other people are and have a poor quality of life, I want her to do everything legal in her power to put me out of my misery. In the good ole USA, that may not be much, especially if this country turns into the gestapo state we seem to be headed toward. In that case, I hope she can take me somewhere that has a more sensible legal view of such things.
