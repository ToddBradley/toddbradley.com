[Picasa: Automated Digital Photo Organizers, Picture Software, Instant Photo Albums, Sharing, Printing](http://www.picasa.com/picasa/) - This is cool stuff. When I read about them being acquired by Google, I downloaded their software. It’s free, and easy to use, and useful. I also got their Hello program, which is a way for people to share photos without using email or a website. You can have it send a photo into a Blogger blog, too.
