Oh, and did I mention that Beth and I went to see [Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World](http://imdb.com/title/tt0311113/combined) last weekend?  It was entertaining, but neither of us felt it was worthy of an Academy Award.  I was a little disappointed, I think, because I’d just finished watching the two new [Horatio Hornblower](http://www.aetv.com/tv/shows/horatio_hornblower/) movies that the A&E network released in December.  I really preferred the acting and casting in “Horatio” over “Master”.  Russell Crowe just doesn’t cut it as a British naval officer.


And did you know the character of Captain Kirk (of “Star Trek”) was supposedly based on Horatio Hornblower?
