[The logical Fallacies: Index](http://www.datanation.com/fallacies/index.htm) - I’m so happy to have found this web page. I learned the names of many of these logical fallacies in Philosophy class in college, but that was 18 years ago now! Every once in a while, I hear someone making an argument that totally doesn’t hold water and am frustrated I can’t remember the mistake they’re making. Hopefully, if I read through this website a couple times, some of this stuff will stick with me.
