I went to the doctor this morning.  You see, I have high cholesterol.  I’ve been taking medicine the past couple years to reduce my cholesterol level, but my last blood test showed that it’s elevated.  Not as bad as before taking the medicine, but higher than it should be.  So I went into the doctor, who prescribed a new medication for me, and also - of course - reminded me that good exercise, good diet, and losing some weight will all also help.


On my way out of the office, around 9:15 AM, I stopped to chat briefly with the doctor’s assistant, who was complaining that she was having a hard time gathering together enough pocket change to go to McDonalds.  And then I saw the popular, tiny red can on her desk.


So, I’m standing there thinking about how ironic the whole situation was.  My breakfast was a glass of low fat milk and some high fiber cereal, I’m on cholesterol medicine, and still they’re saying that my cholesterol is too high and I need to eat better.  And the medical assistant is having a Red Bull and Egg McMuffin for breakfast.
