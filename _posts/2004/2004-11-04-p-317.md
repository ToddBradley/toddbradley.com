First off, Beth won the bet.  She said we’d know who won the Presidential election sometime today, and now we do.  It wasn’t who she hoped it would be, but she was right that we know the answer today.  I’d expected it to go to court and not be resolved until next month.


Second, I added up how many of the things I voted for won and how many things I voted against lost.  Usually I’m about 50%, I think.  This year I did much better.  13 out of my 18 issues ended up winning.  Now, I’m counting all the judges who were retained as a single issues.  That’s about 72%.  I guess more and more people are following my lead and voting the same way as me!


Finally, this now makes 5 Presidential elections I’ve voted in, and my candidate has never one.  I’m now 0 for 5.  Not a great track record, I must admit…
