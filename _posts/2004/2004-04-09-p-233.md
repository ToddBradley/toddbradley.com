I visited an ear specialist today, to see if he could figure out what’s wrong me.  You see, I’ve had ear problems for the past 9 years, and even wrote a song about them - “What It Sounds Like To Be Todd” on 404 Not Found’s “[Nightmare Lullaby](http://www.404notfound.net/othercds/lullaby.html)” CD.  I recently went to my regular ear, nose, and throat specialist, Dr. Warren.  He still can’t figure out what’s wrong with me, so he sent me to a guy who specializes just in ears, Dr. Muckle.  It turns out that there’s a name for my ailment.  It’s called “autophony” and can be caused by a number of things.  So, now I’m going to get some more tests.  The first is a CAT scan to see if I have something abnormal inside my head.  The second is called an electrocochleograph to measure how my inner ear responds to sound.  Then I go back to Dr. Muckle to review the test results.  Oh boy!
