## [About Google Desktop Search]({% post_url 2004/2004-10-15-p-297 %})



[About Google Desktop Search](http://desktop.google.com/about.html) - Word on the street (OK, hallway conversation with someone who tried it) is that the new Google Desktop Search is very cool.  I’m downloading it now, to try it on my work PC.  I suspect it would be even more useful at home, though.
