Washington was a trip. Ha ha, what a pun! I made the mistake of thinking I’d be able to get around fine by taxi, so I didn’t rent a car. Big mistake, given where my hotel was - in the middle of nowhere. The Practical Software Testing Techniques conference was poorly attended, but I learned a lot and people liked my presentation.

Last night, Beth and I went to see “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”. It blew me away and caused me to have an existential crisis.
