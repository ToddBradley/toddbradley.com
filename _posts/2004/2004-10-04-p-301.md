[CNN.com - SpaceShipOne captures X Prize - Oct 4, 2004](http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/10/04/spaceshipone.attempt.cnn/index.html) - Wow, they did it! I know it sounds cruel or maybe pessimistic, but I figured that one of the 3 flights would end in disaster, given that this has never been done before.
