[William Gibson](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2004_10_01_archive.asp#109785164964793835): “‘Bush talks and thinks like Milosevic. He will lose, but the most disheartening thing is the prospect of his religio-nationalist reality-deniers clinging fiercely to the sacred glory of their Lost Cause for the next hundred years. We live under the Confederacy. We’re a podunk bunch of swaggering pious hicks.’ ” - Excerpt from an email between Bruce Sterling and William Gibson
