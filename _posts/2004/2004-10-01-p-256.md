## [the switch is made]({% post_url 2004/2004-10-01-p-256 %})

I’m now totally switched over to my new PC, which I called Barracuda. I moved it over to my desk, after tossing my old PC aside. I’ll come back to that later and install Linux on it.

In other news, I got 3 vaccines today: tetanus, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B. They said I need to come back in a month for a 2nd injection for one of the hepatitis vaccines, but reading up on them on the CDC website, I’m confused. CDC says you need 3 shots to be immune. Hmm….
