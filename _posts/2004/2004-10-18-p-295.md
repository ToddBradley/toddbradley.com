## [our first diving class]({% post_url 2004/2004-10-18-p-295 %})



Well, we did it!  The weekend scuba course Beth and I took is now done, and we passed!  That was the “confined water diving” section, which was half classroom lecture (and exams) and half instruction in the Front Range Community College swimming pool.  Now we’ll get a referral letter from our instructor which will allow us to continue our training by doing 4 open water dives in Mexico (or somewhere else) and then finally be officially certified (albeit novice level) divers.  The first day of the course (Saturday) was tougher on Beth and me than we expected.  I had some problems equalizing pressure in my ears, and Beth had trouble doing the “mask clearing” skill.  But today (Sunday) was a whole lot better for both of us.  And even after 4 hours in the pool, I didn’t want to leave when the class was over.
