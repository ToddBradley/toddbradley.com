## [Frank]({% post_url 2004/2004-12-11-p-334 %})

I’m working today, Saturday. I’ve got a lot of stuff I want to get done, plus I need more time to prepare for JBoss training, which starts Monday morning. Since I’m the only one at the office, I decided it’s a good day to listen to Frank Zappa. So, for the first time in quite a while, I’m tracking through Joe’s Garage. What a piece of work! One of my favorite lines:
