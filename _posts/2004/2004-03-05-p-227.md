I got a very kind email today.  Someone on the net (I have no idea where he really is) read [my page about  Ahi](../ahi/), my notebook DAW, and all the problems I’ve had (and subsequently solved).  He was also having audio dropouts every 68.5 seconds, just like I was.  But my page got him unstuck, so he wrote to me to say thanks.  The most gratifying part was this:


So now I don’t cringe every 68.5 seconds, when a killer tune suddenly skips, and I can relax and listen to smooooooth sounds.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I am eternally grateful and in awe of your godlike troubleshooting skills.  You have the patience of a saint and the persistence of a pit bull.
