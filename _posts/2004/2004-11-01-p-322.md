[Yahoo! News - Top Stories Photos - Reuters](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/041101/photos_ts/mdf745293) - I don’t know how long this photo will stay at this URL, but it’s a young (apparently attractive) woman with a t-shirt that says, “REPUBLICANS ARE SEXY.”  On her head is a Wisconsin “cheeseheads” hat with a Bush Cheney ‘04 sticker.  It takes all kinds!
