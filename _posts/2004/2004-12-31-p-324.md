Did I mention we had a great Christmas? Beth and I drove to my parents’ house near Redstone, CO. My brother Kent and my cousin Deb and her husband Rick drove up on Christmas day for dinner. We were joined by a couple neighbors, too. Christmas dinner was fantastic, of course. The day after, we went to Glenwood Springs to soak in the pool. Then we rode up the tram to the Glenwood Caverns. We didn’t take the cave tour, but just ate a late lunch at the top of the mountain. On the 27th, Beth and my mother went shopping in Aspen while I just hung out and relaxed at the house. We drove back home on the 28th.
