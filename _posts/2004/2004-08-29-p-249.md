Turns out I don’t really need Haloscan anymore, anyhow.  I’d written in [this blog entry](/) that I was disably Haloscan (a commenting service for blogs). But then I just discovered today that Blogger has that built in nowadays! Looks like there’s lots of stuff Blogger.com offers that I didn’t know about. I suppose I should try to keep up on these things.
