## [Bye bye A9 toolbar]({% post_url 2004/2004-11-12-p-311 %})



Well, I’ve tried it for over a week, but I’m removing it now.  That’s the [A9 Toolbar for Firefox](http://toolbar.a9.com/).  The thing is just so freakin’ slow that it makes Firefox unusable.  I was originally very excited about it because it can keep bookmarks synchronized on different computers running Firefox.  Maybe I have more bookmarks loaded into the thing than it’s designed for.  Anyhow, I’m dumping the A9 toolbar and now I’m going to use the [Bookmarks Synchronizer](https://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=14&vid=15&category=Bookmarks) extension for Firefox.  It keeps bookmarks in sync by putting them on an FTP server of your choice, then when your browser starts or stops, it re-synchronizes and merges.
