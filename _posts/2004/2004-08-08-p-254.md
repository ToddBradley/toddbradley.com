Since I haven’t seen any comments on any of my blog entries in the past 4 months, I decided to stop using Haloscan.  It’s a very nice service, but I just don’t need it.


I’m using ChoiceMail One these days for my anti-spam program.  It works very nice.  Guess how much of my emails are spam.  Can’t?  Well, since June 22, 2004, 87% of all the messages in my inbox were unwanted.  That’s 8567 messages.  Imagine if I could somehow charge each of those spammers just one dollar per message…
