Wow, I’m not updating my blog very often.  I guess that shows things have been pretty busy in my life, lately.  Especially at work.  The biggest event of the past couple weeks was that the final performance of the 404 Not Found Live quartet was on April Fool’s Day.  We played at the D-Note in Arvada.  It was fun, but the end of an era.


Here are a couple quotes I saw in someone’s signature on Usenet today:


| “The most important thing is for us to find Osama bin Laden. It is our| number one priority and we will not rest until we find him.”|           ~ George Bush Jr. 2001-09-13|| “I don’t know where he (bin Laden) is. I have no idea and I really| don’t care. It’s not that important. It’s not our priority.”|            ~ George Bush Jr. 2002-03-13
