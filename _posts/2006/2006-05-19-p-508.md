Last weekend was the first of what I hope will be many raft trips this season. About 14 of us went to southern Wyoming for a day trip on the North Platte. I paddled my inflatable kayak in the morning and then switched to the oar boat in the afternoon. Zip wanted me to learn to row so I can row that raft for the big trip over Memorial Day.

Here are some photos I took. They’re not overly exciting. Just mainly some shots to jog my memory later on what the place looked like. I got pictures of the campground, folks having breakfast Saturday morning, and getting the boats ready at the put-in. Unfortunately, I don’t have any photos of the canyon or river or the 4WD road we had to take to get back to the highway from the take-out.

Next weekend should be more fun, I think. We’re going to the Gunnison in western Colorado, and will be on the river 2 days, with a 1 day layover in Dominguez Canyon.
