The video for part of the surgery is a 67 megabyte MPG file.  Most of the few people who read my blog probably don’t have the bandwidth to want to download such a thing, or don’t care to watch it.  But if you’re curious, let me know by leaving a comment here and I’ll upload it and write a little bit about what you’re seeing.  It is actually somewhat interesting.


Oh, and I forgot to mention that all the photos from the surgery are [here](/).
