Here’s a recipe I just made up this evening and it was very tasty.  I served it with Orange Hazelnut Asparagus and some fresh grilled tuna.


Rice Pilaf


Ingredients


2 cups brown rice


3 green onions


1/2 red bell pepper


1 medium carrot


1/2 cup fresh pineapple


3 fresh mushrooms


10 macadamia nuts


1 Tbsp soy sauce


Preparation


Wash the rice and cook in a steamer.  Preheat oven to 350 F.


Chop the green onions, red bell pepper, mushrooms, and pineapple .  Shred and then chop the carrot.  Toast the macadamia nuts, and then chop them up in a food processor.


Once the rice is done, pour it into a baking dish.  Mix in all the other ingredients except the soy sauce.  Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes.  Take off the foil and bake for another 15 minutes.


Stir it up, right before serving.  Drizzle the soy sauce over the top.
Makes 4 servings.


Note: My original plan was to add a small can of diced green chiles and 3 Tbsp of uncooked canned peas.  But I got distracted making the fish and forgot to throw those in the baking dish.
