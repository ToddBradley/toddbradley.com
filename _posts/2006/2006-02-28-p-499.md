## [stock options]({% post_url 2006/2006-02-28-p-499 %})


Why is it that whenever I work at a company that gives me stock options, the stock price immediately sinks below the strike price of those options?  And then when it turns around and heads up, the price has great resistance at exactly my strike price?  Murphy’s Law, I guess.


I’ve got some options at Polycom that I got when they bought Voyant, and the strike price of those options is right around $20.  Well, of course as soon as Voyant got bought, Polycom’s stock price sunk like a stone.  Now, 2+ years later, the price is coming back up finally.  But it’s stuck at between $19.25 and $19.75.  It just can’t seem to break through $20.00.  And I want a Mac and a new bicycle!
