I bought [one of these](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/stats/macbook-pro-core-2-duo-2.33-15-specs.html) last weekend. Now I have 2 Macs, a G5 desktop and this Core 2 Duo notebook.

I’ve been trying to lose some weight this year, and have hit my goal for Thanksgiving with some room to spare. I’ve lost 24 pounds since mid-April, 18 pounds of that in just the past 6 weeks. So I celebrated by having a (non-Diet) Coke and some nachos today.
I updated my [online wish list](/wishlist/) with a bunch of stuff I want for Christmas.

I’m going to work a few hours tomorrow (Saturday) so I can take off work early on Tuesday and attend a [bris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bris) for [this little guy](http://www.houseofpearlman.org/blog/archives/72).
