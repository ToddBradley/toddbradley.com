Here’s the announcement for a theater production I’m in next month. I’ve got a few small parts on stage, plus I’m the sound designer and musical director. And I have a small part in a short film that’s part of the show. Last year’s production sold out and we had to turn dozens of friends away. So if you’re one of the 3 people who actually read my blog and you want to go, you better get tickets soon!

Conviviality Community Theater and Entertainment Company

This year the Conviviality Theater Troupe takes on the sacred terrain of love and relationships. Ripe for lots of laughs, our typical over-the-top approach to examining these basic elements of humanity will provide an evening of entertainment and a lifetime of warped memories.

Reservations accepted and encouraged:

In response to the over-capacity interest in last yearâ€™s show, â€œSpace Monster on Danger Beachâ€, this show has moved to the larger venue of the Nomad Theater. In anticipation of the frenzied excitement when the doors open we ask that you make a reservation if you plan to attend the show.

General admission seating will be $10. We will also have a limited number of Gold Circle Seats in the front center section for $20. Please make your reservation by sending an email to <theater@conviviality.org> with the word â€œreservationsâ€ in the subject line. You will receive additional information in a reply message. Reservation holders need to arrive before 7pm to secure their reservation. The doors will not open to those without reservations until 7pm, so if you have a reservation and arrive before 7pm you will be guaranteed a seat. So write now to: <theater@conviviality.org>
