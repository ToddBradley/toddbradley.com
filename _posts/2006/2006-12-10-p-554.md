Beth and I just joined our first [CSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture), [New Moon Farms](http://www.newmoonfarms.com/).  In case you don’t know, CSA stands for “community supported agriculture” and the idea is that you buy a share (or, in our case, a half-share) of one growing season at a local farm.  The farmers plant, raise, and harvest the food, and then split it up among the members of the CSA.  So, if it’s a good year, we get lots of food.  If it’s a bad year, we get less.  But regardless, it’s all fresh locally-grown stuff raised by a farming family we can meet and talk to, as opposed to coming out of some faceless megacorp at the local supermarket.


We’ll get fresh produce, herbs, etc. every Wednesday from May until October.  Presumably, a half-share is enough for 1-2 people, so I hope we won’t have so much we have to throw anything out.  Of course, it’s possible that if it goes well, we could do a full-share in 2008 and then store some of the food over the winter.  But that might require getting a bigger freezer or a dehydrator.  I think I’m too lazy to can stuff in Mason jars.
