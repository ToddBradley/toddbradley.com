I’m not sad to see Mr. Rumsfeld become unemployed, of course.  But Bush’s idiocy never ceases to amaze me.  Why is Rumsfeld resigning after the elections?  If Bush had half a brain and any loyalty to the Republican Party, he would’ve replaced Cheney and Rumsfeld 2 years ago.  If he’d done that, I think these elections would’ve gone much more to the side of the GOP.  It’s like quitting smoking after you get cancer and have one lung removed.  Why didn’t you think of that before things got so bad?  I think it just shows how out of touch with reality our President is.
