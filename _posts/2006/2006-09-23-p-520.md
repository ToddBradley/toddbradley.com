I took my Dodge Dakota pickup in for service this past week.  I hadn’t been happy with Northglenn Dodge for a long time, and so when a friend recommended Stang Auto Tech in Broomfield, I decided to try them out.  The truck just needed a regular oil/lube and a radiator flush, so it wasn’t a huge repair or a huge bill.


But, a couple days later, I got a thank you card in the mail.  Not just a form letter either - this one was hand written and signed by the owner of the company and his wife.  Now that’s the kind of customer service you just don’t see around these days, and what makes for customer loyalty.  You can bet I’m taking my truck back there next time it needs service!
