I’ve got a Gmail account, but I don’t really use it for much.  But I can see how it would be convenient to be able to access my email from any computer with an internet connection.  Do any of you use Gmail as your primary email address?  If so, drop me feedback and let me know what you think of it.

I use mine. I started it as a permanent address that wasn’t hotmail or yahoo, but here’s the nifty thing. I have all my gmail forwarded to my ISP account. So if I have to list my email addy somewhere, I list the gmail, but I actually read it from my adelphia account. And if I switch providers again (this is my third in a year!), I’ll just have my gmail forwarded to the new box. 
Also I like that it sorts the spam instead of deleting it. Sometimes mail from an editor will come from a different addy than what I have in my address book, and it will slip into the spam folder. So I wouldn’t know I’d been rejected if they just deleted it for me.
