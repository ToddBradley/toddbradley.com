## [I’m down to one crutch]({% post_url 2006/2006-02-08-p-493 %})



Went to the knee doctor today.  I’m now officially allowed to be “partially weight bearing” meaning I’m down to 1 crutch instead of 2.  And I start physical therapy ASAP.  The goal is for me to be able to walk without pain within the next 2 to 4 weeks.
