Oh, and I was going to mention my disappointment at two facts I learned this weekend.


First, the Pappadeaux’s restaurant in Westminster, which was originally scheduled to open in Q1 of 2006, is late.  According to the manager of their other store, it’s more likely to open in July or August.


Second, I’d heard that there’s going to be an Apple Store opening at FlatIron Crossing mall (which is only about 5 miles from our house by car - less by bike, actually).  They’ve been running job ads since December, so I assumed that they were going to open fairly soon.  However, according to the person at the Cherry Creek Apple Store I talked to, they’re going to open in May or June.  I had been thinking that if they opened in the next month, I could be one of their first customers for my iMac purchase.  But I don’t think I want to wait until May or June.  So I’ll probably buy the iMac online.


And now I’m off to physical therapy!
