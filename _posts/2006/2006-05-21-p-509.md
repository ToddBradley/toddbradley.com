You know what I didn’t mention in the my short blog entry about the drive to Wyoming last weekend? For only the 3rd time in my life, I saw moose, elk, deer, and pronghorn (antelope) in the same day. One of the previous times was in Yellowstone, and the other was driving to the Denver Creek campground northwest of Granby.
