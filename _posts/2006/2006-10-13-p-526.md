## [404 Not Found (the band) links]({% post_url 2006/2006-10-13-p-526 %})


I got a domain renewal notice a couple weeks ago for the domain 404notfound.net.  That’s been the home of my musical project / band for the past several years.  But I decided not to renew it.  First, after the “live rock band” version of the 404 Not Found project broke up, I haven’t felt like using that name again.  Second, I haven’t been playing any music at all lately.  Instead, I’ve been focusing on filmmaking.  Unless I have a huge change of heart, I think I’ll keep myself busy enough with making movies that I won’t have time for making music for quite a while.


So, I’ll keep the old [404 Not Found website](../404notfound/) pages as part of my general [www.toddbradley.com](/) site.  But the name 404notfound.net will go away and be snatched up by someone else.


That said, if you’re interested in grabbing some tracks from either of the best two 404 Not Found CDs, you can download tracks from the iTunes Store and from eMusic.  Here are the links:
