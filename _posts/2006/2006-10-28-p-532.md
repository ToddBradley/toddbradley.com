Beth and I are strongly considering taking the 100-Mile Thanksgiving Challenge. But it’s a bit difficult. (I guess if it was easy, it wouldn’t be a challenge, now would it?)

So far we’ve found a decent variety of ingredients all grown or raised locally - beef and pork, mushrooms, cheese, pumpkins, squash, and beans. But I doubt we’re going to find some of the stuff that’s pretty traditional for Thanksgiving. For example, I doubt there is a flour mill within 100 miles that mills wheat grown within 100 miles of here. So that eliminates most kinds of bread, rolls, pie, and cake. There’s a turkey plant right here in Broomfield, but I don’t think they have a retail outlet and I have no idea where their turkeys come from.

And just try finding salt, pepper, wine, beer, or soft drinks where all the ingredients are from 100 miles or less from Broomfield! Even Coors, with their famous “Rocky Mountain Water” (formerly “Rocky Mountain Spring Water” but they dropped the “Spring” a while back) uses hops from too far away.
