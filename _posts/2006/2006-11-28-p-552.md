## [my shoes]({% post_url 2006/2006-11-28-p-552 %})

These are the best athletic shoes I’ve ever bought: the [New Balance M1222SG](http://www.newbalance.com/productbrowser/product_details.html?g11n.enc=ISO-8859-1&feature=Newbalance.com&gender=Men&product=M1222SG&product_type=shoe&sport=None). I got them at the local New Balance store in Broomfield, where the salesperson took the time to get me just the right pair of shoes. They feel so good, and I’ve been able to run without knee pain for the first time in literally 18 months (since I screwed up my knee the 2nd time, had my 2nd knee surgery, and then went through rehab).
