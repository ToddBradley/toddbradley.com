Chad Johnson’s a good friend of mine from high school. We played in a heavy metal cover band called DERT and did covers of songs by Quiet Riot, Twisted Sister, and the like. Later, he gained local notoriety by being in a band called Small Fish in the Eureka, California area. Well, Chad’s now pushing 40 and makes TV and radio commercials for a living. Here’s some of his work:

From what I can tell, the music and singing is all him, and almost all of the voiceover is him, too. Plus, he directs and shoots and edits the commercials.
