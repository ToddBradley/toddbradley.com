I’ve got an email list I use for announcements about films I worked on or acted in. But I decided to set up a Google Calendar with the same info. Here it is, in all its heavy coolness. If you use Google Calendar, you can add this calendar to your own so you see events all in one calendar view. Thanks, Google!
