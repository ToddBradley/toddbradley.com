## [don’t bother trying to create a website with a Mac]({% post_url 2006/2006-11-21-p-548 %})

I thought this was funny. I use siteground.com as my web hosting company. I thought I’d try out their web-based SiteBuilder application. But when I clicked on it, I got this error message:

Mac computers cannot be used to create sites; They can be used to view the final results.

Please note that finished websites created with this system can be viewed with any browser version 5.0 or better on almost any computer with 800×600 or better resolution.
