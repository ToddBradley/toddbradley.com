Yesterday, I got 10 spam blog comments and 0 real blog comments. I was tempted to just turn commenting off completely on my (undervisited) site. But Beth convinced me to leave it on. So I upgraded to the latest version of [WordPress](http://wordpress.com/) and installed the [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) plug-in, which is supposed to dramatically help cut down comment spam. We’ll see! So spam away, comment spam bots…
