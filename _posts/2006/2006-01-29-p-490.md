This is so cool! I had no idea that there was such thing as a client-only wiki. My experience has always been with wikis being server software. Mind blowingly awesome. I’m going to start using the [Ten Foot Wiki](http://www.unclebear.com/tenfootwiki/) for a future D&D game that I’ll run for my friends.
