## [lots of stuff this weekend]({% post_url 2006/2006-02-27-p-496 %})

It’s a glorious Monday morning, and we’ve had a busy weekend.

Beth had fight class, of course, Friday night. Then Saturday we got up extra early and drove down to Denver to a particular house across the street from a park where a rare bird had been spotted. Beth was lucky enough to spot this bird, which normally ranges only into Texas, but is off course in Colorado for some reason.

After that, we went to a coffee shop and filmed a movie! It was another improv movie by Patrick Sheridan. I brought Beth along to help out on the set, but she ended up acting in it. And I wanted to just do sound, but I acted (a little) in it, too. Not sure what it’s going to be called.

Then we went to Pappadeaux’s for a mid-afternoon meal that was lunch and supper together. In celebration of Mardi Gras, all their crawfish dishes were half price, so you can imagine what I had. Enough crawfish that we brought home about a full meal’s worth.

Saturday night we went to the 50th birthday party of Frank Boles, where we ate and drank and sang along to karaoke!

On Sunday morning, we spent some precious time at home, but then went into Boulder to see Shakespeare. [The Upstart Crow](http://theupstartcrow.org/) was performing “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” and we caught the matinee. It was a very funny production, and we enjoyed it. One of the actors told me afterwards that they were extended the show for another 2 shows since they’ve been selling them out pretty consistently. That’s awesome! Ironically, attendance at The Upstart Crow’s shows were down so much last year that they moved into a smaller theater this year. Now they’re selling out every show.

In the evening, the director of a local short film called “[The Breakup Bunny](http://breakupbunny.com/)” came over to show me her project, and see if I was willing to do sound editing on it. It looks like a fun and quirky little film with fairly good production values (especially since this is her first attempt at writing and directing her own movie). Plus it’s got a couple actors that I’ve worked with before - Carl Anderson and Leigh Ann Hubbard. So I agreed to help out. I’ll probably spent one weeknight and one weekend day cleaning things up as much as possible and re-recording some dialog.

Meanwhile, I have ideas for 3 separate short films that I’d like to make. And I’ve got a DP on board for the first one, which is a documentary type piece. We may start as early as Thursday on that. I’m planning to get an Apple iMac with Final Cut Studio within the next couple of months, so I can do video editing (and sound editing) at home. But I’m not sure how I’m going to pay for it. Boy I hope Polycom’s stock prices soar in the next month!
