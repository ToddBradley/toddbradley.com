## [I’m now on Flickr]({% post_url 2006/2006-11-13-p-541 %})

I decided to start using Flickr to host my photos, and just signed up for a pro account. That’s the one that costs $25 a year but allows you to upload lots more photos and doesn’t show ads to your visitors. Anyhow, here is a link to my Flickr page.

So far, I just have photos from the 2005 Bradley Family Reunion and from the Kansas City road trip that Beth and I took last weekend. If I can figure it out, I’ll try to post a photo from Flickr straight into my blog.
