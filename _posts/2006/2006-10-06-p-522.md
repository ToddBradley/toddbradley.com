I got my first ever sub-30 minute bike commute this morning.  Well, since I moved to where I live now, at least.  Last Friday, I set my personal best commute time from work to home at 36:13.  This morning I rode from home to work in 29:52.


The morning commute is easier, given that it’s mostly a slow and gradual downhill ride with about a mile of steep climb at the end.  Going home in the afternoon, I get to coast for that mile, but then it’s a long grind the rest of the way.


And best of all, nobody tried to run me over today!  (yet)
