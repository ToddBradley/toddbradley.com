Occasionally, a friend or family member asks me to let them know when one of the movies I’ve been working on is showing.  Well, I won’t be at either of these showings, but…


“Seven Cups of Joe” is showing this Thursday (3/9/2006) at Starz Filmcenter in the Tivoli.  I acted and did sound editing on that one (and most of the sound recording).


“Breakup Bunny” is showing next Thursday (3/16/2006) at the Bug Theater.  I did sound editing on that one, although I can’t say it’s really finished yet.  This showing will be something of a “work in progress” I think.


Email me if you want more info on either of those short films, or how you can see them.  Or how to get my autograph.
