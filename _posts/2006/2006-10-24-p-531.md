In the same day, Apple has (finally) released the [new Intel Core 2 Duo based MacBook Pro](http://www.tuaw.com/2006/10/24/apple-releases-macbook-pro-with-intel-core-2-duo/) notebooks and the [Mozilla project](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/) is [supposedly releasing Firefox 2.0](http://www.tuaw.com/2006/10/24/firefox-2-0-final-due-out-today/). Yikes! If I only had three grand sitting around in a bank somewhere waiting around to be spent on something… Oh wait, I do!
