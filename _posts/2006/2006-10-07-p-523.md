I forgot to mention this, though it happened several days ago.  Not even a week after I got a thank you note from the people at Stang Auto Tech, for taking my truck there for service, I got another personalized thank you note from the owner and head chef at a restaurant we visited a couple weeks ago.  The restaurant is called Rioja, and it’s on Larimer in downtown Denver.  The food there was very good, although the service from our waiter wasn’t outstanding.  But it was nice getting a card from the proprietors afterwards, thanking us for our business.  I thought maybe I’d written a mini-review of Rioja, but I guess not.  Anyhow, it’s expensive and didn’t seem unusually Mediterranean (which is its supposed theme), but it was quite tasty.
