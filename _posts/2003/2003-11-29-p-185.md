I’m a regular blood donor at Bonfils, and I got a call from them shortly before my knee surgery asking if I could come donate.  I declined, given the upcoming surgery.  They called again and left another message a couple days ago, so I just called them to find out how long I have to wait after surgery before I can come donate.  The answer is that I need to wait until my “doctor releases me” and says I can “presume normal activities.”  I’m not exactly sure what that means, but I’ll ask my doctor on Tuesday when I visit for my followup.
