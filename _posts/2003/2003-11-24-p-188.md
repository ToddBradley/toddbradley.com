[Rocky Mountain News: Local](http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_2448179,00.html) - Your money at work: the new “Healthy Forests” bill will take $760 million of taxpayer money and give it to logging companies.  Doesn’t it seem absurd that the government should take one person’s money, use it to pay another person to cut down trees that belong to all of us, and sell it to another private business?  Something doesn’t seem right about this.
