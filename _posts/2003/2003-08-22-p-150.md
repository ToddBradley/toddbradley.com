[Yahoo! News - CBS Reaches Deal for Elizabeth Smart Movie](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=597&ncid=772&e=3&u=/nm/20030821/tv_nm/media_smart_dc) - Aha! I just knew Elizabeth Smart would be coming back to the spotlight before long. See my blog entry from July 4, if you don’t believe me. I wonder what angle this TV movie will take. Actually, I don’t wonder too much. It sounds like they’re taking the consumer-friendly “kidnapping” angle rather than the much more interesting (and possibly true) “runaway” angle.
