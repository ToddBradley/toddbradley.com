I just cancelled my membership to [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/).  I decided a better way to use that $21 a month is to spend $5 to upgrade to digital AT&T cable now that it’s available in our area (and we’ll get 4 or 5 HBO channels instead of the 1 we have now), plus $2 a month on TV guide magazine, and donate $5 or $10 a month to the local library which carries a growing number of DVDs and music CDs.
