Well, it’s Friday now.  On Wednesday, Beth and I went into Boulder for some errands and lunch.  I was getting around pretty good on one crutch, but I think I overdid it that day.  I had more knee pain than I’d had since the day of the surgery.  So I decided to take it easy for a while.  Yesterday was Thanksgiving, of course, and I spent the day watching TV, playing TFC, and working on my band’s website.  Then, we went over to Jon and Raechel’s for Thanksgiving dinner, which was very nice.  Afterwards, the 4 of us played a game of Spacefarers of Catan.


Today, the knee machine is back upstairs in the guest bedroom, and I’m on it again.  It just wasn’t working very well on the couch downstairs, mainly because the couch isn’t long enough and so I had to sit up at a weird angle.  And this was causing pain on my knee once in a while.  Now that it’s back on the bed, it’s a lot more comfortable and I feel like it’s doing more good than harm, which I wasn’t sure of on the couch.


This morning, I’ve been doing some web surfing and working on stuff for the band a little.  But most important - willing my knee to heal.
