I bought a TiVo expansion from [http://www.weaknees.com](http://www.weaknees.com/).  It arrived earlier this week, but I didn’t have time to install it until just now.  Supposedly I now have up to 237 hours of TiVo recording capacity.  Of course, that’s at the lowest quality.  Now that our TiVo has so much space, I set it to always record at the best quality.  Still, we’ll have something like 100 to 150 hours of capacity, I think.  That should be enough - in combination with now having around 5 HBO channels - to mean we almost never have to visit Blockbuster.
