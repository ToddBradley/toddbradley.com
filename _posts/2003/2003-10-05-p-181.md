I used the TiVo to watch my first pseudo-realtime football game today.  I started the thing recording at the start of the game, but I didn’t come start watching for another hour or so.  Then, I was able to skip over the commercials and halftime, but pause it whenever I wanted to do housework.  I caught up with the realtime game a couple times and then went to do more chores, then - because I was skipping the boring parts - I’d catch up again.  It really demonstrates how little of a 3.5 hour football game is really the game of football.  Most of the game is commentary, commercials, and guys standing around between plays.
