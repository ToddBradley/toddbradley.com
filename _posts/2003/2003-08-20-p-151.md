[Yahoo! News - Ashcroft Defends Secret Searches in Patriot Act](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=584&ncid=584&e=1&u=/nm/20030820/pl_nm/security_ashcroft_dc) - I love this quote: Most Americans expect that law enforcement tools used for decades to fight organized crime and drugs should be available to protect lives and liberty from terrorists. The Patriot Act makes that possible. I wonder how he determined that “most Americans” believe that the government need not notify a property owner before they search his property. They sure didn’t ask me! And drawing the parallel to the “war on drugs” is priceless. I suppose if you believe that the “war on drugs” has successfully achieved its goals, then the logic may hold. Do you think most Americans believe the “war on drugs” was won or is being won?
