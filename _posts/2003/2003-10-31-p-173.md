The new 404 Not Found CD (titled “Paper Cuts”) is really coming along.  This week, Byron mixed 3 of the tracks for the CD, along with some guidance from me.  There’s just one track I have that needs some more work and then I have to mix my stuff, and then put the CD together.  I’m already working on liner notes, artwork, labels, etc.
