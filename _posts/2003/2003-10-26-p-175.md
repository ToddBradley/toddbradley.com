Last night I went to Best Buy and bought a new TV and TV stand. After talking about it for weeks, lots of shopping, and a few false starts (for instance, I was going to buy them Friday night but when we got the store, Beth thought we should get a $3000 TV instead of the $900 one, so that delayed us a day while she thought about how silly it is to spend $3000 for a TV), we finally got the Toshiba 36AF43. It’s a 36 inch flat screen TV from Toshiba. Man, this thing is big, and weighs nearly 200 pounds. It’s still sitting out in the truck and I have no idea how we’re going to get it in the house. But our old TV, which I inherited from my grandmother when she died several years ago, was just getting too old. The picture’s fuzzy and has been for some time, plus it doesn’t show the entire picture - the sides get cut off.

We put together the TV stand last night and now that I’ve finished my breakfast cereal I’m going to go disconnect all the old components and get the old TV and stand (an oak entertainment center, actually) out of the way, then put all the components back together on the new TV stand. Then will come the challenging task of getting the new TV in through the door and set up.
