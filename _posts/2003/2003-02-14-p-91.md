[Web site design UK, webdesign lab](http://www.webdesignlab.co.uk/niksthings/masking.html) - Check this out.  You too can play the monkey’s uncle game.  It’s pretty funny.  Thanks to my friend Chad for the link.


In other news, Beth had Lasik surgery yesterday.  So we’ve gone from an “8 eyes” household to just 4.  We’ll donate our old glasses to charity, just in case there’s some poor guy in Afghanistan who happens to have the same sucky vision I had before my surgery.  She seems to be recovering well.  The “happy pill” they give you before surgery seemed to work on her, whereas mine didn’t do anything for me.


Also, I found out this week that my company takes Presidents’ Day off, so I get an unexpected 3 day weekend!  I’m happy about that.  I have ordered a lot of new gear for my portable recording studio, and hopefully I can get it all put together tonight and Saturday.  Then I can try it out Sunday and maybe Monday, recording some drums over at Byron’s.
