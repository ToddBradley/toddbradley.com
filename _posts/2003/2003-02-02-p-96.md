It’s 1:45 AM Sunday morning.  Beth and I just got back from Denver, where 404 Not Found played a show at the Linoleeum art gallery.  Wow, talk about a fiasco.  The original schedule we were told was for the first band to play a 30 minute set starting around 9:30.  Then we’d play a 30 minute set.  Of course, there would be some transition time in the middle.  The way it really worked out was the opening act started at about 10:15 and played until 11:30.  Their “30 minutes” turned into a pair of 30 minute sets separated by a break.  So I guess we started around 12:15 or so and played our allotted 30 minutes.


Then we got lectured on our lack of professionalism by the other band’s “sound guy”, who was so drunk he could hardly stand.  He was unhappy that we left some drinking cups and water bottles on stage when we left.  He didn’t seem to understand when we explained that it was his band’s trash, not ours.
