I now have a new PC called Ahi.  It’s a vpr Matrix 200A5 instead of the 185A5.  The Firewire port works.  Hurray!


Also, I went in for my 10 day eye checkup.  They told me my vision is progressing normally, and the problems with night vision I’m having are normal.  I’ll go back in another month and a half.
