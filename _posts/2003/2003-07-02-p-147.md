[Yahoo! News - U.S. Confidence in Iraq War Drops - Poll](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=584&ncid=584&e=2&u=/nm/20030701/pl_nm/iraq_usa_poll_dc): “37 percent said the Bush administration deliberately misled the American public about whether Iraq has serious weapons of mass destruction” - I guess I’m still in the minority on this one, though the minority has grown from 31% to 37% since early June.
