I just put an ad in Westword (printed and online) and on <www.musicmates.com> for a bass player for 404 Not Found. I put up ads at Guitar Center and Musician’s Superstore and to a couple newsgroups a couple weeks ago, but nothing promising yet. Hopefully we’ll get some interest from the Westword ad, but the 404 Not Found thing is so atypical, it’s rare to find people who are into it. Most bass players want to play rock and metal cover tunes in bars, it would appear.
