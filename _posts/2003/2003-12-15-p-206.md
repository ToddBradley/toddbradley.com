[Yahoo! News - U.S. Says Saddam Held Under Geneva Convention Rules](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=584&e=1&u=/nm/20031215/pl_nm/iraq_usa_dc): “‘He is being treated in accordance with the Geneva conventions and provided protections of a prisoner of war,’ McClellan told reporters.”  This contrasts to the situation with the Afghan prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, who are not being held in accordance with the Geneva conventions.  It’s nice to see we’re abiding by international covenant in at least one case.
