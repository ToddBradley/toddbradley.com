[Don’t See](http://teamhouse.tni.net/scrapbook/Epp/dontsee/dont_see.htm) - I particularly like the photo at the bottom of this page.  I wonder if we’ll see a backlash against people who talk on cell phones while driving carelessly.  I’ve read that both the insurance industry and the US government have completed studies that show that people on cell phones are more likely to be in car accidents.
