Today’s the big day.  I’m going to get my knee “scoped”.  That’s short for “outpatient arthroscopic surgery”.  I’ll be on narcotics the next few days, so who knows if I’ll have the wits to write in my blog.  But I’m going to try to record a solo album while I’m convalescing.  Stay tuned.


Speaking of music, the official release date for 404 Not Found’s “Paper Cuts” CD is going to be Friday, December 12, 2003.  We’ll start taking advance orders sometime before that so everyone can get their copies in time for Christmas.  Still trying to figure out where the CD release party will be…


Gotta run.  There’s a scalpel with my name on it in Golden.
