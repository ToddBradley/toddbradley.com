[Yahoo! News - Shooting of father a tragedy](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&ncid=389&e=3&cid=389&u=/kr/20030307/lo_krdenver/shooting_of_father_a_tragedy) - A lot of people would argue this is a reason why nobody should have guns in their home. My family had guns in our home, and hunting was a regular year-round affair (I think I went along on hunts for deer, elk, pronghorns, rabbits, ducks, geese, and pheasant all before I was 16). But unlike this poor guy (who, as cruel as it sounds, got what he deserved), my parents taught us to respect guns, to handle them with care, and to use them properly. Sounds like Scot Hoffa should have gone to hunter safety class, like I was required to do, and like he should have required his son to do. Of course, it doesn’t sound like Mr. Hoffa’s weapons were intended to be used for hunting, but for personal safety.
