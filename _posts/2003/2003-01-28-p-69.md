I left work early yesterday to go to the dentist in Boulder. Then I stopped at CompUSA to see if they had any of the new Apple Powerbook 12″ notebook computers on display. Turns out they had one on display, but they sold it. So all they had was a little card explaining what would be there if there was something there. I talked to the guy and he said they have 4 more in the back room but they haven’t been received yet. So he couldn’t open the box to show me. He said to come back tomorrow.

Then I went to a little taco place on 30th. While I was waiting for my food to be prepared, I heard a big WHACK sound outside the restaurant. I looked out and it was a college age kid on a bicycle who had just run into my parked car. He rode off while I walked outside. I looked the car over and didn’t see any damage (in the dark). But when I got to work this morning I noticed that he did leave a dent and scraped paint on the hood. For a moment, I felt upset but then I realized that getting mad wouldn’t do any good since I’ll never see the guy again. And what could I have done if I really had caught the guy and talked to him? Oh well, one more dent in the Civic GX. I’m sure it’s not worth repairing.
