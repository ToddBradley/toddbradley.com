Another one bites the dust. ArtistForum.com is stopping CD sales as of June 1, 2003. They sent me this email today:

Dear 404 Not Found:

Artistforum.com will no longer engage in CD sales and will no longer maintain its webservice. If you would like your stock returned to you COD or if you would like to provide us with a shipping method please email <returns@artistforum.com>

Please be advised that all stock remaining after June 1, 2003 will be donated or destroyed. ArtistForum will not be responsible for any stock remaining after this date.

We thank you for your patronage and wish you the best of luck.

Sincerely, ArtistForum.com

They’re one of only 3 remaining online CD retailers to carry 404 Not Found. And in another couple week, there will be only 2 retailers left! I think that’s 3 companies that started in the dot-com era who at one time did CD distribution for independent artists that are all now defunct. I sent these guys a box of 50 copies of “Eclectronic” on 5/1/2000 and they sold 1 in the past 3 years. Is that a comment on how many fans we have or on ArtistForum’s sales volume?
