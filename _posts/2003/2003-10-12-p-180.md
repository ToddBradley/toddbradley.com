Mom called last night to let me know that my grandfather passed away yesterday.  He hadn’t really been sick lately, as far as they know.  But on the other hand, he’d been slowly going for the past 3 or 4 years.  His liver just finally gave up and stopped working, it sounds like.  No word yet on a memorial service.


Meanwhile, I spent the day doing chores and catching up on email and working on music.  I’m making a solo CD for Scott Siders, dynamic male vocalist of 404 Not Found.  It’s all just Scott’s voice, with some ambient sounds from outside the recording studio on some of the tracks.
