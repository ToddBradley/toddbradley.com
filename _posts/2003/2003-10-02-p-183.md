Today, Beth and I drove down to south Denver and had lunch at [Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen](http://www.pappadeaux.com/).  For the first time ever, I had something other than Pepper Shrimp there.  Instead, I had the Seafood Grill Combo, which was yummy.  Then we went to the new [Wildlife Experience museum](http://www.wildlifeexperience.org/home.asp) in Parker.  It was pretty nice.  I especially liked th LeRoy Neiman exhibit.  After that, we drove to the Ralph Schomp Mini dealership, where we looked at Mini Coopers and I test drove one for a little.  It’s a nice little car.  Beth even liked it a little, though she won’t admit it for fear she’ll just encourage me to buy one.  Then we drove around south Denver finding a CNG refueling station (first time we went to this particular one) and then drove home.
