Well, Saturday, as you can see from my note below, was pretty much wasted dealing with PC problems.  Turns out my notebook’s Firewire connection doesn’t work.  Read more about that at the bottom of the [Ahi page](../ahi/), if you care.  Good thing I’ve got a three day weekend!  It’s Presidents’ Day and for only the 2nd time in my working career, I have today off work as a holiday.  It’s nice.


Yesterday, Beth and I drove to Greeley to see my cousin Jessica compete in a volleyball tournament.  Her team won both games we saw.  It’s a three day tournament with dozens of teams.  I’m not sure how you could stand to watch 3 straight days of volleyball in a noisy gymnasium.  I’d go crazy.  But it was great to watch these games. I definitely noticed Jessica’s team played better when she was on the court, which is great!


Today, I’m catching up on a few things around the house - laundry, bills, etc.  And I hope to do some reading and maybe go see a movie and maybe go dink around in Byron’s recording studio.  We’ll see how it goes.  But now I think I’ll go make a soup and sandwich lunch.
