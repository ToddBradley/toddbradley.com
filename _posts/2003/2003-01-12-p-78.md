[Giant Alaskan Bird](http://www.adn.com/alaska/story/1979660p-2066866c.html) - I had forgotten about this story. I did about 20 minutes of web searching and surfing to try to find if anyone ever posted a followup to the original set of articles in October 2002. But I found nothing. I guess either nobody’s seen it since then or nobody’s writing about it.

In other news, [this](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134589898_raywallaceobit05m.html) supposedly puts to rest the folklore of bigfoot. But will it really?
