It’s Saturday once again. I visited the orthopedic surgeon yesterday afternoon. After a long wait to see him, he told me that my MRI results confirm his theory about what’s wrong with my right knee. So, I scheduled surgery for the morning of Thursday November 20 in Golden. He says I’ll be able to go back to work the next week (though I may take that whole week off since it’s Thanksgiving). I’ll be on crutches about 2 or 3 weeks and then start physical therapy for rehab. He says I should be able to run again by springtime. Hurray!
