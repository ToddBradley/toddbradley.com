I got news from Beth yesterday that Tim’s Net Guru Cafe closed its doors last Friday.  Yes, while 404 Not Found was playing at August Morning Coffee Shop in Longmont, Tim’s exhaled its final breath.  I know it’s just a coffee shop, but it’s sad news.  That leaves Broomfield with no independently owned coffee shops.  It’s all Starbucks and Peaberry now.  Also, as far as I can tell, it also leaves Broomfield without a free internet access point.
