It’s Saturday morning. Last night, 404 Not Found played at August Morning Coffee Shop in Longmont. I think we played more music than any performance we’ve ever done. We had nearly 2 hours of our own material, but took a break in the middle for open mic poetry (only one person was there to read). Things started very slow, but by around 8:45 a big crowd had materialized. If we play there again, I need to remind myself that maybe doing a 7-to-9 show isn’t the best. Perhaps we should do 8-to-10 instead, although August likes to close at 9. But at least we didn’t have to wait until the Celtic band was finished, like last time. Also, it was our first show with a bass player. James joined us for the past few rehearsals and this gig. Now we’re going to rehearse a few times with another bass player named Gene and decide which one’s a better fit for us.
