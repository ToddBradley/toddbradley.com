This past weekend, in addition to being the long 3-day Labor Day weekend, was the first anniversary of the wedding of Beth and me. Sadly, I had to work Friday night and Saturday morning, but Saturday afternoon we got away from town and drove to Minturn. We stayed Saturday and Sunday nights at [The Minturn Inn](http://www.minturninn.com/index.html). It was pretty nice. Saturday night we went to Ti Amo in Eagle/Vail for dinner, and Sunday we drove up the canyon to Camp Hale, then relaxed at the inn the rest of the day. Sunday night, not finding anyplace we liked in Minturn for dinner, we drove to Avon and found a pizza parlor that was pretty good. Then we drove home Monday. I feel like I gained 5 pounds just from all the dining out, but I went to 24 Hour Fitness today and the scale there didn’t show a 5 pound gain (fortunately).

It was nice to get away for a couple days, but the one thing it really showed is how nice it would be to take several days off and just relax, spending time reading and working on my music. We’ll try to do something like that later this month.
