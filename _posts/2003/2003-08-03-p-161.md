I was at a birthday party for a one-year-old yesterday, and someone suggested I should look at my web server logs to see who is visiting my website. They were particularly curious whether my [“ahi” page](../ahi/) had hits that were identifiably from employees of vpr Matrix. Well, if so, I can’t tell from the server log browser my web host provides. However, I did find this interesting. It’s a list of the top 10 pages that people visit on my website:

Top 10 most commonly accessed pages during period: /ahi_digital_audio.htm with 706 page views (11.92% of all traffic) /blog.htm with 654 page views (11.04% of all traffic) /ahi.htm with 467 page views (7.89% of all traffic) /default.htm with 400 page views (6.75% of all traffic) /suvbacklash/stats.html with 208 page views (3.51% of all traffic) /suvbacklash/gx.html with 169 page views (2.85% of all traffic) /suvbacklash/suvbacklash.html with 152 page views (2.57% of all traffic) /tfcguide.htm with 148 page views (2.50% of all traffic) /photos/photos.htm with 138 page views (2.33% of all traffic) /suvbacklash/suvbacklash_archive.html with 137 page views (2.31% of all traffic)

These are from the month of July. So, not counting my home page (default.htm) it looks like by far the most popular sections of my site are the story of my portable digital audio workstation (Ahi), my blog (you’re reading it now), and the SUV Backlash stuff. It’s strange that my blog got 654 hits, and yet not a single person bothered to comment on what I wrote, even though there’s this little “Comment” link at the bottom of every single entry.
