It’s Saturday.  I had to work today, but got out after just a half day.  So it wasn’t so bad after all.


I got emails today from dotster.com telling me it’s time to renew two of my domain names, traditionalsupport.org and coloradobats.org.  I maintain the websites for both organizations, but I think I’m going to let the traditionalsupport.org domain name lapse.  I’m not directly involved in the organization anymore, and the group is so disorganized that nobody ever gives me anything to post on the website anyhow.


I neglected to mention what a great New Year’s Eve we had.  Beth and I went to The Flagstaff House for dinner, mostly paid for thanks to a gift certificate we got as a wedding gift.  It was really good food, though I’m not sure I could justify spending over $200 for a meal for 2 people.  Next time we want that quality of experience, we’ll just go to Bloom, at FlatIron Crossing mall.  After dinner we went to a party co-hosted by some friends of ours.  The other co-hosts (whose house we were at) have a nice foosball table, so I played a few games.  Even though I haven’t played foosball hardly at all since getting laid off from Jabber, it was great fun.  And I played pretty well.
