Oh, one other thing I wanted to mention but forgot: I read on page 061 of Wired 03|2003 about a CD called “Xerophonics: Copying Machine Music” which is music made from the sound of photocopy machines. I did a web search and found some songs to download on [MP3.com](http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/305/xerophonics.html). In reading the little blurb there about the project, I see the CD is going to be released on Seeland Records, which is the label created by the Negativland guys! Wow, I’m jealous.
