[Michael Moore speaks his mind in this open letter to GW Bush. - He’s got some darn good points there, and I agree with just about everything he wrote.  In fact, I suggested to Beth several months ago that Bush’s attitude about Iraq might be different if his daughters were fighting for freedom.  Instead, they’re skipping school, boozing it up, and trying to stay out of the public eye so as to not bring down the President’s approval rating. (Jimmy Carter had his embarrassing brother Billy and George W. Bush has his embarrassing twin daughters)](http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php/index.php?messageDate=2003-03-17)


On the eve of “war” the main thing I keep thinking is, “I sure hope we find the weapons of mass destruction that Bush and Powell insist Iraq has but Blix (even aided by CIA intelligence) has been unable to locate.  Otherwise, the US is sure going to have some egg on our face.”
