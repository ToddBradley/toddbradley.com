[Holiday Snowglobe](http://ww12.e-tractions.com/snowglobe/globe.htm) - I think you’ll like this.  Grab and shake.  Or just watch the little people.


In other news, I got rejected by the 2nd blood bank in a week.  They both said they could accept my blood donation since my doctor said it was OK, and then when I went in to donate, they both said, “Oh wait, we were wrong.  You have to wait 6 weeks.”


Oh, and one other little thing.  “Paper Cuts” was officially released today.  It went on sale at www.cdbaby.com.  “Paper Cuts” is [404 Not Found](http://www.404notfound.net/)’s new CD.  We’ve been writing this material for over year and a half and worked on recording and mixing the CD for a half year.  And now the end product is done and ready to entertain you.
