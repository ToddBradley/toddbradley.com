[Yahoo! News - Baghdad Car Bomb Attacks Kill at Least 34](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=540&e=4&u=/ap/20031027/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq_513) - This is really sad, and exactly how I expected things to turn out with our invasion of Iraq.  I thought back in March 2003 that this was going to just be a military quagmire for the US, and so far it’s looking like I was right.  I figured the best we could hope for would be an Israel/Palestine style continued war of terror and guerrila fighting.  But the Bush administration sold this whole excursion as a quick and clean invasion.  We’ll go in and decapitate the brutal regime, then turn the country over to the Iraqi people to run as a democratic state.  My prediction is Iraq will be no more stable in a year than it is today, and that this is going to be our new Vietnam.  Dissent among US citizens will continue and probably even grow, and eventually - after thousands more deaths - the next President will pull us out, not because we accomplished our goals but because we realize we will never be able to.
