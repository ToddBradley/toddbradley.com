I just finished my first ever [wardriving](../doc/Wardriving-HOWTO.txt) experience. Now I’m safely back home eating a bowl of organic raspberry sorbet. Yum. My home internet connection sucks right now. I’m getting 35% packet loss, for reasons I don’t really understand. My ISP can’t seem to help me. I think the problem is the tree that’s between my antenna and the tower.
