Three years after I posted my [advice to avoid Advance Design of Kentucky](/), I still continue to get email from people who read the warning on my website and appreciate the advice.  Unfortunately, this guy read it too late:


Saw your comments on ADK today. Wish I’d seen them before I plonked down $2500 for a hotted up (RAID, 4 hard discs, etc.) Leoni 2002 model. I got a doorstop good for playing solitaire. Examples:
Supposed to be built with quiet parts, sounds like a wind tunnel. Louder than my 2 SCSI servers together.Supposed to have Plextor CD-RW, came with LG. Brings down XP Pro every time I try to burn a CD.Promises of replacements, never happened.
I share your opinion. Stay away from ADK.
You can add this to your website if you wish.
