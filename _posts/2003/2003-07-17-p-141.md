For my money, I think I’m more impressed with the sound design of Nine Inch Nails’ “The Fragile” 2-CD set than any other musical release I own. It’s been almost 4 years now since this was released, and every time I listen I still think it’s probably Trent Reznor’s masterpiece. I have no idea how he could possibly top it. The songs all go together so well (with one exception - Starfuckers) that I think it even beats “Dark Side of the Moon” as a concept album. And the arrangement, mix, and mastering are unsurpassed by anything I’ve seen. What really impresses me is the mix of instrumental and vocal pieces.
