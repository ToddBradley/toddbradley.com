[Toshiba | SD-H400: Digital Media Server](http://www.tacp.toshiba.com/dvr/product.asp?model=SD-H400) - After being convinced by my parents that we should get a TiVo, I was inches away from going down to Best Buy today and buying on of these Toshiba SD-H400’s. It’s a combination TiVo and DVD player, so we wouldn’t be adding any extra components to our entertainment center. However, thanks to the power of the internet, I found a very useful TiVo site - [http://www.tivocommunity.com](http://www.tivocommunity.com/) - and read some reviews of this box from other people who’ve bought it. Sadly, the Toshiba lacks the 30 second advance (”commercial skip”) feature and it doesn’t allow you to record from the DVD onto the DVR. Without those features, I think I’ll stick with the basic Series 2 TiVO and save myself $200.
