I was relaxing this afternoon in front of the TV and a 30 minute program came on about Elisabeth Smart, the Utah girl who {”was kidnapped” “ran away”} back in 2002 and was found in March of this year. That made me think to myself, “I wonder if there’s been any news about her since she was reunited with her family?” So I did some web searches and found that it sure seems like the answer is, “No.” From what I can tell, within a week after the girl went back to her family, the story totally dropped out of the spotlight. I can’t find any stories about her returning to school, or the kidnappers going to jail, or anything. I’m not sure if this is good or bad, but it definitely illustrates what short attention spans we have. Do you disagree?
