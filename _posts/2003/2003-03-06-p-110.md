Man, I’m not doing a very good job of keeping this updated.  My cold has gotten better, but I still have crud in my lungs.  My fiasco with my audio recording notebook PC is finally over.  It now works.  I had to buy a different audio interface.  I suppose that means I should go update my Ahi project page, which will put Bianca to sleep.  I’m referring to her comment to one of my other blog entries.  I just had another person write back, so that’s 2 in one month!

I’m [selling off](/) a bunch of old PC and music hardware I don’t need anymore.  Please take some of this off my hands!  I’m spring cleaning.  I just spent all evening taking apart my old music computer so I can sell off the pieces (or give them to friends or whatever).


When I took the Honda in for service today, I checked out the new Honda Civic Hybrid.  It was the first one I’ve knowingly seen.  Looks just like a Honda Civic, I guess!  It gets 48 MPG, which is pretty darn nice.


My eye just started itching.  I mention that because as of tomorrow it will be 4 weeks since my Lasik surgery.  My eyes still aren’t great, but they’re slowly getting better.  However, one month after the surgery I’m allowed to rub my eyes again.  I’m still having pretty poor night vision, though I think it’s gotten better.  Also, my eyes are somewhat dry, though not as bad as they were right after the surgery.  I think I have the hardest time focusing in the morning right after I get up.  Then, my vision improves over an hour or so.
