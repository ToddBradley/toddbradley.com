I can’t believe it took me so long to figure this out. The actor who played Saruman in the Lord of the Rings movies and Count Dooku/Darth Sidious in “Attack of the Clones” is the same guy who played Scaramanga, the assassin, in “The Man With The Golden Gun.” I realized this watching the opening scene to Golden Gun on TV just now. I’ve seen this Bond movie probably 20 times, and the LOTR movies a total of 10 times, and “Clones” 2 times. And I just now put it all together. Christopher Lee rocks! According to IMDB he’s been in 222 films in his career.

Speaking of movie connections, I watched “Batman the Movie” yesterday. The beautiful Lee Meriwether plays Catwoman in the film. And here’s an interesting tidbit I learned from IMBD. She’s the same woman who was in the Star Trek (the original series) episode as the woman who can kill people with one touch - the source of one of my favorite lines from the series, “Mr. Scott, there’s a strange woman who knows the entire plans of the Enterprise. AAHHHH!” This follows the “I am for you, Mr. Watkins” line.
