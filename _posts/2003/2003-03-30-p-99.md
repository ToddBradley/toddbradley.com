Friday night I saw two bands for free.  They were playing at Tim’s Net Guru Cafe, which is the location of the Broomfield Poetry Jam.  First up was [Kallisti](http://www.kallisti.us/).  They rocked my fucking ass off.  I really like their sound and their musical arrangement.  Plus they sell CDs for $3.  Where else can you get a great CD for three bucks?  I’d never seen them before, so it was a treat.  After them was [Parker Needs Silence](http://www.parkerneedssilence.com/).  Their drummer is Byron, from my group 404 Not Found.  And their bass player, Steph, is hopefully going to appear as a guest musician on the next 404 Not Found CD.  John is their dynamic died-in-the-wool punk frontman, singer, and guitarist.  I don’t play any music with him, because he would rock my fucking ass off, too, and then my pants would fall off.


In other news, Beth is back in town and I’m working feverishly to get ready for two gigs this week, both of which will have elements we have never done before.  404 Not Found is living on the scary edge between improvisational genius and suckitude this week.
