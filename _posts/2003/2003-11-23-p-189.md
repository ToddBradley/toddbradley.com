I think I overdid it on the movies yesterday. In one day, I watched Terminator 3, The Tuxedo, Solaris, and Coyote Waits, plus some other shows on TiVo. Today marked the 72 hour mark of my recovery, which meant I was able to take off my wound dressings and bandages and finally shower. It was nice. I got all the wraps off my knee, revealing the two small incisions which are sutured up. I took the old gauze off and, after a hot shower, put band-aids over both of the entry points. My knee isn’t swollen very much compared to the other one, but it’s definitely stiff and doesn’t have the same range of motion. So I’m back on the knee machine! Beth made me a lunch of bean tostadas, which was very good. It’s great having someone else do all the cooking and cleaning, although I’m getting stir crazy from spending so much time lying down or reclined with ice on the knee.
