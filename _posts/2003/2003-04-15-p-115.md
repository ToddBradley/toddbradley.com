I got my new Echo Indigo card today, installed it, and mixed down one of the new pieces for the next 404 Not Found CD.  This thing’s great, once you get it installed!  It’s mixing down 24 bit audio like a champ, and sounds great.  It’s got way more headroom than I could want, and is also very, very quiet.
