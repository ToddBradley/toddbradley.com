It’s Monday. Yesterday, Beth and I got home from a 4 day weekend in Orlando, Florida. We had a great time and visited 2 of the Disney parks - Animal Kingdom and MGM Studio. You can see a bunch of photos I took from the trip [here](/).

My favorite rides were the Dinosaur in Animal Kingdom and Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster in MGM Studio.
