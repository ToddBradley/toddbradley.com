I just finished watched the 2nd of the two-part “miniseries” of Battlestar Galactica.  This is a brand new one, featuring Edward James Olmos as Commander Adama.  It was produced for the SciFi Channel, where it was first presented last week.  I really enjoyed both two hour episodes, even though they didn’t really wrap anything up.  That was on purpose, of course.  Just like with their production of Riverworld, they’re hoping people liked it enough to warrant further episodes, either as a miniseries or a regular series.
