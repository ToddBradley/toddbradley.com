I’m back already.  The surgery went just fine, apparently.  We got home around noon.  My pain medicine makes me very sleepy, but after taking an hour nap I’ve been able to (slowly) catch up on my email, thanks to my laptop and the wireless network.  Right now I’m on our guest bed, with my leg slowly moving in the thing they call the “knee machine”.  It is really called an Artromot K4 and looks like [this](../images/artromot_k4.jpg).  It is moving my knee slowly through a range of motion from 0 degrees to 40 degrees, with ice on top to keep the swelling down.  I am supposed to use the knee machine 6 to 8 hours each day to stimulate healing and prevent scar tissue from building up.  I guess if the knee heals without going through its range of motion, you’ll get scar tissue on the inside, which is bad.  I found it a little tough to sleep while the thing’s going, but it’s not a problem to just let it run while I use the laptop.
