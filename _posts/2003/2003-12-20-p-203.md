## 



Since I’ve been using my Midiman Radium-61 MIDI controller keyboard exclusively these days, I’ve found a lot of things I with they’d designed better.  A week or two ago, I was inches away from just giving up on the thing and buying a different keyboard.  So I spent a lot of time reading reviews and specs about every MIDI keyboard I could find.  In the end, there was at least one fatal flaw with every one of them - some feature they neglected to include or something they skimped on that an existing user was complaining about.


So I decided to take the time to write up the features of my ideal MIDI controller keyboard.  If anyone ever makes one with these specs, I’ll buy it in an instant.


all settings are retained in memory even with power off


61 full-size plastic, semi-weighted keys with nice action (preferably like the Alesis QuadraSynth Plus Piano)


solid (not flimsy) pitch bend and modulation wheels


4 to 12 knobs or sliders - can be programmed to send any MIDI command


4 to 12 buttons - can be programmed to send any MIDI command


2 separate dedicated buttons for program change increment/decrement


input for sustain pedal


input for volume/controller pedal


velocity sensitive with aftertouch


selectable velocity map


interface: USB in/out to PC, MIDI in from another device


power: uses USB bus power or wall wart


price: $200 to $400
