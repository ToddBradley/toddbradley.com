[Yahoo! News - Medical Marijuana Sold in the Netherlands](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20030901/ap_on_re_eu/netherlands_medicinal_marijuana_1): “Recent studies show a small increase in the number of people in the Netherlands who say they have tried marijuana, but overall use levels remain well below those in the United States despite the drug’s widespread availability here [in the Netherlands].” - I wonder why it is that Americans are more likely to use marijuana.  Post your theory!
