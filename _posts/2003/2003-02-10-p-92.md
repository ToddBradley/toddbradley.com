I’m making some slow progress getting Ahi set up for music.  I was playing around with Cakewalk SONAR 2.2 on the new PC yesterday and found there was an undesireable delay between when I pressed the Play button (or, in my case, the space bar) and when SONAR actually started playing music.  It wasn’t just a couple hundred milliseconds.  No, this was more like a 4 to 5 second delay.  So I just went through a [bunch of suggestions](http://www.musicxp.net/) for tweaking Windows XP for audio work.  We’ll see if those help.


Also, I moved all the music files from Anemone over to Ahi and Sponge, in anticipation of shutting down Anemone for good.  I’ll keep the accessories to be able to plug into Ahi so I have a full size keyboard and mouse.  I’m not sure what’ll happen if I plug an external monitor into the notebook.  Will I get a dual head display or just the same display shown twice?  If the latter, I’ll pass.  You see, my notebook’s display is actually larger than the 17″ monitor I have attached to Anemone.  And it’s a lot clearer.


Next, I’m going to try out the demo of Kantos 1.0 that I downloaded.
