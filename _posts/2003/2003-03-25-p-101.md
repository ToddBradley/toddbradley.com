In case you’ve been in Osama’s cave, I’m sure you’ve heard that Iraq claims to have captured some American soldiers and is holding them as prisoners of war. The Bush administration has been basically saying, “You better treat those guys right, or you’ll be war criminals.” (see [here](http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/2059099/detail.html), for instance) In particular, they’re complaining that showing TV broadcasts of these prisoners is against the Geneva Conventions.

It’s ironic that the US is saying that, though, after we have been holding Afghan soldiers in Cuba - in conditions contrary to the Geneva Conventions - for the past year and a half. [Here’s an interesting article that foreshadows what’s happening now](http://www.hrw.org/press/2002/02/geneva0207.htm). This guy wrote a year ago that the Bush administration’s refusal to abide by the Geneva Conventions “puts soldiers around the world at risk, especially U.S. troops who might be captured in combat.”
