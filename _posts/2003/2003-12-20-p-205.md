Well, it’s done!  Last night my band [404 Not Found](http://www.404notfound.net/) played our first gig since August.  That was a 5 month hiatus from live performance.  The event was our CD release party for “Paper Cuts” and it was at the Somewhere Else Bar & Grill in Denver.  I liked the venue, although the sound system fell short of expectations.  One of these days we’re going to have to just get our own PA and live sound engineer, I guess.  It’s really tough to play these kind of places and get Scott’s voice to be loud enough to be well understood by the audience without causing feedback.  We sold a lot of t-shirts and CDs - more than at any other gig ever.  My cousin Darlene and her husband Dean even came to the show.  Sadly, though, not a single one of my friends showed up.  Beth says it’s because none of my friends are really Friday night party people.  They were probably all at home taking care of their kids or watching TV.
