It’s Tuesday. I took Friday and Monday off work to go to Grand Junction and then Redstone. Friday, after driving to the Western Slope, we went for a long hike with my dad up Dominguez Canyon. We were looking for desert bighorn sheep, but didn’t see any. But we saw some birds and nice rock formations, instead. Saturday, I spent the morning running errands and then that afternoon was the memorial service for my grandmother, Delma North. She passed away on March 31 at the ripe old age of 92. I had thought of trying to write something to say to everyone at the memorial, and I had a great idea but just didn’t have time to fully develop it, since my life has been so hectic the past couple weeks. I may be able to turn it into a little article for the North Wind, which is the family newsletter for that side of my family.

Saturday night we drove up to my parents’ house in Redstone. Then, Sunday was Easter. We had a lot of family staying in Redstone - people who had come to town for Delma’s memorial and Easter. My mom made Easter dinner for us all. It was a feast, of course. Three pies! Monday morning we came home, stopping long enough to visit my grandfather in the nursing home in Carbondale (he had no idea who we were and mostly just drooled while we talked to him). That afternoon caught up on bills, etc.
