Have you heard that putting the pit (seed) of a fresh avocado into a bowl of guacamole will help keep it fresher longer? Well, it turns out to not be true. It’s just an urban legend or old wives tale. I couldn’t believe that, because I had done the same thing myself for years and thought it appeared to work. So, I decided to put it to a test. [Here are the Flickr photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/20201392@N00/sets/72157603985110160/) showing what happens to guacamole in three different states: uncovered, covered with plastic wrap, and in contact with an avocado pit.
