If I had my way, here are the types of restaurants that people would create in Broomfield:

- small family owned diner and coffee shop near Highway 287 and Miramonte, not unlike Mel’s Diner (which only stayed open less than 2 years, I think)
- fairly nice Indonesian restaurant
- Hawaiian BBQ, including plate lunch
