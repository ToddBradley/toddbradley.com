I’ve never owned a Lenny Kravitz album before. But a couple months ago I heard a song on the radio that was such an authentic homage to Led Zeppelin that it just blew me away. And so I had to buy his newest CD. The song is called “Bring it On” and the album is his latest - “It Is Time For A Love Revolution.”

The composition and arrangement are totally like something Zeppelin would’ve done circa 1971. The only thing missing is the squeak from Bonham’s Ludwig Speed King kick drum pedal. Nice job, Lenny.
