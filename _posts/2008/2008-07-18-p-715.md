This morning, I broke my personal best bike to work time.  Today was 25:58, which is 49 seconds better than my previous best of 26:47, set a couple months ago.  I had a bit of good stoplight karma and low traffic because I left the house at 7 AM.  Woot!


Did I mention how much I love [my new bike]({% post_url 2008/2008-04-22-p-696 %})?
