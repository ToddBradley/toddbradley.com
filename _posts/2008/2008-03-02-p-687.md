I watched “[Garden State](http://imdb.com/title/tt0333766/)” last night. I’d heard about it since it came out, and thought it just didn’t seem like my kind of movie. I was wrong. I really liked it. I thought it was some pretty good writing. Plus it’s got some awesome acting in it. [Natalie Portman](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000204/) plays a character that is so likable and so unlike any character I’ve seen her play before, that I just got a sense of amazement at her performance. Knowing that she also speaks Hebrew (being a native of Israel) I decided to go check out YouTube to see if I could find any footage of her speaking Hebrew, since I’ve only seen her in movies speaking English. I [found](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KQzvIdyI70) [a](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAmrBhQl2_E&feature=related) [few](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Apwv89WXTE&feature=related).

As part of revising the sci-fi action movie script I’ve been working on with Betsy Dornbusch, I bought a few DVDs recently. I guess it kinda ties in with the new “[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles](http://www.fox.com/terminator/)” TV series that [I’ve been watching religiously]({% post_url 2008/2008-02-19-p-683 %}), too. In the past 10 days, I’ve watched 2 episodes of Sarah Connor, plus the original “[The Terminator](http://imdb.com/title/tt0088247/)” and “[Terminator 2](http://imdb.com/title/tt0103064/)” on DVD. I had forgotten just how good both of the first two films are. You may not know this about me, but for 2 or 3 years after “Terminator 2” was released, I wrote movie reviews for the company newsletter of the software company where I worked. My movie ratings were always on a scale of 1 to 100 with 100 being as good as “Terminator 2”.

A couple days ago, the “[Aliens](http://imdb.com/title/tt0090605/)” DVD arrived by mail, but I haven’t watched it yet. Maybe I’ll do that today, but I’ve got a lot of chores to do around the house, since I spent all day yesterday goofing off.

Finally, you may already know that I saw “[Juno](http://imdb.com/title/tt0467406/)” over Christmas break and was impressed with Ellen Page, the leading actress. I was rooting for her to win the Academy Award last week, but she didn’t. Now that she didn’t win, I think she can safely come out of the closet. She was the host of “Saturday Night Live” yesterday and they even wrote a skit with a nod at how she’s such a big fan with the lesbian community. My prediction: she’ll be in People magazine within 2 years, along with her lesbian partner.
