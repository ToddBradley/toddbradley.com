I’ve been getting way too much comment spam lately. Even though perhaps only one real person posts a comment to my blog every month, I get several spam bot replies every day. So I added a Word Press plugin called [Math Comment Spam Protection](http://sw-guide.de/wordpress/plugins/math-comment-spam-protection/). Basically, it just means that to submit a comment you have to pass a brief math test. How brief? Well, can you calculate the sum of 2+5? If so, you can pass the test and therefore leave me a comment. If you can’t, I assume you’re a spam bot, and good riddance!
