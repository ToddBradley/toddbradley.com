I just filled up my gas tank yesterday, something I don’t have to do very often. This is the one on my 1984 Kawasaki KZ550 motorcycle. It looks like after the tuneup I had done a couple weeks ago, I’m getting almost exactly 38 miles per gallon. That’s mostly city driving. And my riding style is pretty much the opposite of “[hypermiling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermiling)” since I often can’t resist the urge to accelerate fast, especially when it’s so hot and the only way to cool down is in a 70 mph breeze.

38 mpg is a lot better than the 15 or so that our Dodge Dakota pickup gets, but I still wish I was getting 45 or 50. Since some of my coworkers have cars with air conditioning, stereo systems, and seating for four that get 38 or better, it seems a little embarrassing that’s all I’m getting on a motorcycle.
