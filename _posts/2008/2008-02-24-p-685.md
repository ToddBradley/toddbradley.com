I was just reconciling my latest Visa statement, and found a fraudulent charge for $4.99 from “[Bestsmartstore Com Llc](http://bestsmartstore.com/index.php)” from February 14.  I checked out the company’s website, and learned they are supposedly an “e-book” vendor but we haven’t bought any e-books from them.  I googled the company and found that the only hits were people talking about fraudulent credit card charges.  So I called our Visa company and disputed the charge.  Of course, they closed the account immediately, which means I will now have to change over all our automated billing (stuff like the monthly Netflix bill) to a new card.  Yuck.  The amount of time it’ll take to deal with the fallout will end up being worth way more than the five bucks of the fraud charge, but what can you do?
