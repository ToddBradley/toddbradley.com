[Pentagon tells Bush: climate change will destroy us | Environment | The Observer](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2004/feb/22/usnews.theobserver)
The document predicts that abrupt climate change could bring the planet to the edge of anarchy as countries develop a nuclear threat to defend and secure dwindling food, water and energy supplies. The threat to global stability vastly eclipses that of terrorism, say the few experts privy to its contents.

I’ve been working on the script for a short sci-fi action movie with a [friend of mine](http://www.blogger.com/profile/15527483283426518167). It’s set in a post-apocalyptic Boulder County, sort of like a “[Road Warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Warrior)” type place. The story’s explanation for why the world has plunged into such grimness is that Gulf War III escalated to nukes. But this (purported) Pentagon report gives me a much more realistic idea. I couldn’t have worded our story synopsis any better than the above paragraph from The Observer.
