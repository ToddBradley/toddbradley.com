I just found out some exciting news! Broomfield is getting a real natural supermarket. It’s not Wild Oats / Whole Foods, or even Vitamin Cottage. It’s Sprouts Farmers Market. Supposedly they’re opening in October next to Staples near (or in, maybe) the now-defunct Albertson’s on 120th.

I’d never heard of Sprouts before, so I had to check it out. You can, too, by going here:

The only problem is it’s not actually in Broomfield. That side of the intersection is Westminster. So Westminster now has a Wild Oats, a Vitamin Cottage, and soon a Sprouts. And Broomfield’s got Wal-Mart, King Soopers, Safeway, and soon another Wal-Mart.

Ever wonder why Westminster is able to get all the coolness, and Broomfield isn’t? I wonder, too.
