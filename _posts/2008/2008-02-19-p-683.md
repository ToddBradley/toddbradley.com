I’ve been getting into this new TV show with an unwieldy long name: Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.  I really didn’t want to like it, but I’ve been getting pulled in.  And then earlier today, while at home enjoying President’s Day off work, I watched last week’s episode on TiVo.  It was really good in a lot of different ways.  Now I can’t wait to watch tonight’s episode.


Sure, Summer Glau’s acting isn’t the greatest, and she can’t deliver the one-liners anywhere near Governor Arnold.  Some of John and Sarah’s interaction with their personal terminator bot is a far-fetched.  And the production is a bit too Hollywood.  But there are occasionally some really good action sequences, and a nicely unfolding plot arc with some of the minor characters.


If you haven’t seen it yet, check it out.
