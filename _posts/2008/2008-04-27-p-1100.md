Yesterday, I had a few friends over.  I didn’t feel like cooking for them, and wasn’t too excited about the usual fast-food or carry-out options.  So we settled on ordering some pizza for delivery.  I’d just gotten a flier from Pudge Bros. Pizza, so we decided to give it a try.


We ordered two pizzas, a 14″ Hawaiian and a 14″ with half sausage and half pepperoni.  Delivery was reasonably prompt and courteous, but the pizza was unanimously blah.  Of the four of us, nobody was really excited about the two pizzas we got.  The crust was just so-so at best.  The cheese was pretty sparse.  And the toppings tasted like they were made by the lowest bidder, which is probably true.  In fact, I think the pepperoni was the blandest I’ve ever had.  I think they left out the “pepper” and just gave us the “oni” whatever that means.  I was hoping their “original zesty” sauce would liven things up, but it didn’t.


So, I told my friends that if I’m in the mood for pizza ever again in the future, don’t let me order from Pudge Bros. Pizza.  It’s tough to get a great pizza by delivery out here in the suburbs, but I think I’d rather just get something from the Taco Bell drive-through than eat this stuff again.
