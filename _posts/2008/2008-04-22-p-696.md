I’ve been working some extra hours nights and weekends for a friend of mine who needs some help at his startup company.  I submitted my first invoice to them last week and decided to celebrate by spending my check in advance.  I bought a new bike!

It’s a 2008 Trek Soho 1.0.  To celebrate Earth Day, and because I got so fed up with RTD yesterday, I rode it to work today.  This bike is noticeably faster than my other commuting bike.  So I’m sure once I really try, I’ll blow away my ride-to-work speed record which I set last summer.


Note: The above photo is not me.  That’s a model, posing by his trendy bike with his latte.  I don’t look nearly as cool.  But you can read more about the bike here:
