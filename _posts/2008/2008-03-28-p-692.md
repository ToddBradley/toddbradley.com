[The Portable Dry Ice Maker. at Hammacher Schlemmer](http://www.hammacher.com/publish/11096.asp?promo=74614)


I read about this in the latest issue of Wired Magazine.  And if I thought anyone would ever get it for me, I’d put it on my wishlist.  But at $500, that’s just not going to happen.  In short, it’s a “portable” dry ice maker that cranks out a one pound block of dry ice in 60 seconds.  Of course, you have to hook it up to a big industrial bottle of compressed carbon dioxide, which makes the “portable” part a little laughable.  But I just think it would be awesome to have my own easy supply of dry ice at home for parties.  I guess I’ll file this one under “Food”.
