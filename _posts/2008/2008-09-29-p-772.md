From [The Smoking Gun](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/hlocklearmug1.html):
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested by the California Highway Patrol in September 2008 on suspicion of driving under the influence of prescription drugs. After receiving a call from a motorist who saw the 47-year-old Locklear driving erratically, officers found the TV star parked on the side of a road blocking traffic. She was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail where she posed for the below mug shot before posting $5000 bail.

Is it Botox, or is it the prescription drugs?

By the way, I wonder whatever became of Yasmine Bleeth. Years ago, after she got arrested for cocaine possession, I put up before and after photos of her, like below:
