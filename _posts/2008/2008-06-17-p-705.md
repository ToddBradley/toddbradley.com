Ever had someone ram a tube down your throat into your stomach? I’m now scheduled to have just that very thing done. Here’s the description of the procedure:

> [Esophagogastroduodenoscopy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy)
> In [medicine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine) ([gastroenterology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology)), esophagogastroduodenoscopy is a [diagnostic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis) [endoscopic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy) procedure that visualises the upper part of the [gastrointestinal tract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract) up to the [duodenum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum). It is considered a [minimally invasive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimally_invasive) procedure since it does not require an incision into one of the major body cavities and does not require any significant recovery after the procedure (unless [sedation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation) or [anaesthesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaesthesia) has been used). A [sore throat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngitis) is also common.[[1]][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGD#cite_note-0]([2)][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGD#cite_note-1]([3)](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGD#cite_note-2>)

Sounds like loads of fun, eh? That’s what I’ll be doing the afternoon of Tuesday June 24. Why? Because I have unexplained anemia, and it sucks.

   Are you asking what happened to cause me to have to have an EGD? Or what happened to the guacamole?
