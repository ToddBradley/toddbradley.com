At first I thought they were weird. But now that I’ve lived with a pile of external drives for a while, and now that the Drobo supports FW800, I decided to get one. It should arrive next week, and then I’ll consolidate all my external drives down to this thing and never have to worry about backups again.

I hope it’s as good as they say. I’ll hopefully post an update in a couple months with how I’m liking it.
