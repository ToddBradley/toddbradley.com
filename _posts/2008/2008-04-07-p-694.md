(I would insert a goatse-themed tax-related image here, but I don’t know of any)

Hurray, I just finished doing our 2007 taxes! They weren’t as bad as I expected, I guess. Beth did all the gathering-up of the receipts for charitable deductions and her income, which helped a lot. I did the rest, and nothing big went wrong. We owe money to both the state and the feds, unfortunately - on the order of two mortgage payments. Yuck! I guess we didn’t withhold nearly enough last year. But at least it’s done. Now it’s time for a stiff drink.
