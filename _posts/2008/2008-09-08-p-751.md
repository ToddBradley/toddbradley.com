Beth’s on this kick where she’s sampling chocolate from every single store in the Denver metro area, and then writing articles on which ones are the best. This means that we are now on a 94% chocolate diet. And at the current rate, I have a feeling it’s going to take about 8 more weeks for her to get through just the first half of the alphabet. I am so sick of chocolate already!

But if you want to know where to find the best chocolates in Denver, [go check out her blog](http://bethpartin.com/).
