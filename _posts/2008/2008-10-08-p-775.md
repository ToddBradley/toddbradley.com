My awesome new television arrived yesterday. It’s a Samsung LN46A750 high definition LCD TV. To go with it, I bought a Sony BDP-S350 Blu-ray Disc Player. Together, they’re amazing! The first two discs I bought are “Blade Runner” and “The Fifth Element”. Last night, I watched parts of “Blade Runner” in 1080/24p and tonight I’m watching “The Fifth Element” in the same resolution. Wow!

And watching them so close to one another, I realized a connection that I never quite put together. I’d always thought that the character of General Munro in “The Fifth Element” looked familiar to me.

And I just realized while watching the movie tonight that it’s the same actor as played Leon from “Blade Runner”!

A quick search on IMDB confirmed it’s the same guy, named Brion James. Sadly, Mr. James died of a heart attack in 1999.

I thought it was a weird coincidence that the first two Blu-ray discs I ever bought both have the same actor.
