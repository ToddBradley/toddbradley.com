I read this article on the TreeHugger blog this morning:

[Five Outstanding Green Restaurants : TreeHugger](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/10/five-outstanding-green-restaurants.php)

Like it sounds, they review 5 “green” US restaurants. Sadly, no restaurants from Colorado made their list. What’s your favorite “green” restaurant using the same criteria as TreeHugger? They said this:

> From a pure food standpoint, we looked for restaurants where the chefs are serious about sourcing their food and prioritizing quality of ingredients over technique. That means the food at all of these restaurants is as [local](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/10/www.treehugger.com/files/2008/03/green-basics-eat-local-food.php) and [seasonal](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/10/www.treehugger.com/files/2008/09/seasonal-restaurants-are-trendy.php) as possible, decidedly simple, and assuredly delicious.

Personally, I like Sunflower in Boulder. And I think Rioja in Denver uses a lot of local stuff, but their prices keep us from going more than once a year. There was also a neat little vegetarian cafe upstairs at a bookstore in Aspen last time we were there. Any others we should try?
