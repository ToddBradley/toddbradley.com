## [back from vacation]({% post_url 2008/2008-06-09-p-702 %})


Hi, everyone.  Beth and I just got back from a 2 week vacation yesterday.  It’s good (and bad) to be back.  We spent lots of time in and around canyons.  I guess that was the theme.  Beth took hundreds of photos, and I shot about 90 minutes of HDV video.  So much that it’ll take weeks or months to edit into something presentable.

The main waypoints with the letters are locations where we stayed at least one night.  I’ll tell you more later.


I think we drove over 1700 miles, heard 5 different languages spoken, and slept in 4 different states.   We saw desert bighorn sheep, Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, and my first ever California condor!  Plus lots of other birds, a bat or two, a snake, and a few bugs.

Sounds very very nice. I’m waiting for photos.
