[Cyclist critical after being hit by car : Broomfield : Broomfield Enterprise](http://www.broomfieldenterprise.com/news/2008/jun/09/cyclist-critical-after-being-hit-car/)

I just read this article this morning:

> A 24-year-old driver from Boulder was cited for misdemeanor careless driving after he hit and critically injured a 57-year-old bicyclist Monday afternoon in Broomfield.
> Walter Johnson ran into the back of the woman’s bicycle at about 11 a.m. while driving a 2002 Saab southbound on Simms Street about a half-mile south of 128th Avenue, according to the Colorado State Patrol.
> The State Patrol determined that the cause of the accident was inattentive driving. Alcohol, drugs and speed were not suspected.
> The cyclist, Rhonda Kobi, of Northglenn, was taken by ambulance to St. Anthony Central Hospital in Denver with serious injuries, according to the State Patrol. She was listed in critical condition Monday night. 

I think the author must be a little confused about the location of the incident. It must have happened 1/2 mile south of Colorado Highway 128, since Simms Street doesn’t go within a 1/2 mile of 128th Avenue, as shown by this map:

You may be wondering how it is that the driver hit the cyclist hard enough to critically injure her, and then get off with just a misdemeanor. That’s what Beth just asked. I’m not sure.
