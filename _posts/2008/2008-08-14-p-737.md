Woot.  One of my coworkers was proud yesterday that he set a new personal best bike-to-work time.  So when I got up this morning, I decided I should do the same.  And I did!


My new record is 24:43, which 75 seconds less than my previous best.  I frankly don’t know if I can improve on this without getting in substantially better shape.  I was pooped when I got to work.
