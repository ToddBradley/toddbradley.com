You know how it seems like the stores put out their Christmas displays earlier and earlier every year?  Well I was in the local Target today, to find some stuff for my Halloween costume.  Let me say that again for emphasis: I was shopping for a Halloween costume, because it’s October 30.


And inside the store right next to the Halloween stuff, they had Christmas decorations and a big LED sign that said, “Christmas countdown: only 55 days left!”  Oh sweet Jesus!  It’s enough to make a guy want to become a Jew.
