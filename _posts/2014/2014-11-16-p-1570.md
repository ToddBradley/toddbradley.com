For Thanksgiving this year, Beth and I are volunteering at the [Turkey Trot](http://www.unitedwaydenver.org/turkey-trot), which is a big race in Washington Park (Denver) to raise money for the Mile High United Way. I volunteered two or three times about 10 or 15 years ago, but not recently. After that, we’re gonna make a semi-traditional Thanksgiving dinner at home. And then possibly go see a movie.

For a moment I thought of doing the 100 Mile Thanksgiving Challenge again. I did that years ago and won a prize for my menu. All the ingredients were grown or raised within 100 miles of home, except for some things like salt. But it’s tough to round up all the ingredients to pull that off. So here’s what I have planned this year:

- roast turkey: I ordered a small non-GMO free-range turkey from [Mary’s](http://www.marysturkeys.com/), and plan to roast it in a pretty traditional manner. Not smoked, not brined.
- wild rice and sausage stuffing: Beth loves her mother’s stuffing recipe, but it’s not really compatible with how we’re trying to eat these days. So I chose this recipe, which is lower carb and has more interesting ingredients: [wild rice, sausage, and fennel stuffing](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Wild-Rice-Sausage-and-Fennel-Stuffing-893)
- cranberry sauce: Beth wants to look at Whole Foods and see if they have anything made fresh and local. I’m guessing they won’t, so we’ll probably just get this from a can.
- green salad: This is pretty standard fare, and I don’t have plans to do anything unusual or special here. I’ve really grown fond of [Annie’s Goddess Dressing](http://www.annies.com/products/dressings-oils/goddess-dressing-8oz)lately.
- maybe gravy: Beth really likes gravy, and even though we’re not having mashed potatoes she may make some to put on the turkey.
- chocolate mousse: We’ll buy this or something similar from a local bakery. I’m just not into making desserts.

What we’re not having: mashed potatoes, bread, bread-based stuffing, pumpkin pie, the American green bean casserole thing
