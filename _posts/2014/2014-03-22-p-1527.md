Beth and I moved from south Boulder to central Denver about a month ago, but I think it didn’t fully sink in until just today how wonderful it is being in a real neighborhood of a real city. I’d seen some small signs over the past month, like the fact that I calculated there are [seven coffee shops within a half mile]({% post_url 2014/2014-02-21-p-1501 %}). And, of course, the fact that it takes 30 minutes to drive to an actual suburb. And the fact we can easily walk to the Fillmore Auditorium, the [state capitol](../wikipedia/commons/8/81/Colo_state_capitol.jpg), Voodoo Doughnut, Cherry Creek, the Denver Art Museum, and four different supermarkets.


[![Today's Walk](/assets/img/converted/today-walk.png)](/assets/img/converted/today-walk.png)But today’s experience was special in how mundanely urban it was. I needed to go to King Soopers pharmacy to pick up a prescription refill, but Beth took the car today. So I set out on foot, [Audiobook in my earpods](http://www.audible.com/pd/Arts-Entertainment/Iron-Man-My-Journey-through-Heaven-and-Hell-with-Black-Sabbath-Audiobook/B00AIUSWPC/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1395521904&sr=1-1). I wanted some lunch, so I decided to stop in at a [pho restaurant that I hadn’t visited before](http://phoon6.com/). After lunch I walked up to the pharmacy and got my prescription. But then I realized I was next door to [one of the coffee shops](http://www.dazbog.com/) on my checklist, so I stopped in for espresso and a scone. Refortified against the spring snowstorm, I set out for home.


But then I passed by a little neighborhood Ace Hardware I didn’t even know existed. It’s the exact opposite of Home Depot, more employees than customers, a small shop where you can buy everything you need in 5 minutes, and no parking. I remembered we needed a few things for the new apartment, so I stopped in and picked them up. Then I set out again. Oh, but wait, Beth mentioned the other day we’re out of tonic water, and there’s a liquor store right next store. Another stop. After that I passed by a cleaners (the fourth one I passed on this walk), an antique store, the [mysterious walled-off](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=St+Germain+Foundation&hl=en&ll=39.728412,-104.975245&spn=0.011898,0.022724&cid=15670074584805193115&gl=US&t=m&z=16&layer=c&cbll=39.728323,-104.975245&panoid=vB6U0E_guoqltJ7E2HXP9g&cbp=12,197.28,,0,13.77) premises of [an international religious cult’s](http://www.saintgermainfoundation.org/) [mansion](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=St+Germain+Foundation&hl=en&ll=39.727274,-104.975309&spn=0.011899,0.022724&cid=15670074584805193115&gl=US&t=m&z=16&layer=c&cbll=39.727267,-104.975419&panoid=uFtxx4UFyoiLM6KOtRt7Iw&cbp=12,318.64,,0,4.08), and [some other mansions](http://www.leonardleonard.com/congress/7thave.shtml), before finally getting back to [our apartment](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=534+E+7th+Ave,+Denver,+CO&hl=en&ll=39.727265,-104.979944&spn=0.005949,0.011362&sll=39.727041,-104.980361&layer=c&cbp=13,181.81,,0,-6.47&cbll=39.727267,-104.98021&hnear=534+E+7th+Ave,+Denver,+Colorado+80203&t=m&z=17&panoid=PuM51Bl6iBekl-RHDby9FA).


I’m glad to be here, in a real neighborhood in a real city.
