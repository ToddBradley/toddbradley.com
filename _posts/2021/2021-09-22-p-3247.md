September 22, 2021


All good things must come to an end. Today was the last day of vacation, and not very interesting or exciting at all. But at least it started nice, with breakfast in bed. It wasn’t fancy, but my Airbnb reservation included a simple breakfast. I chose the breakfast croissant sandwich with fruit. And coffee from a Keurig. My room at this Airbnb had two single beds, and therefore no room for a chair or a table or desk. So I ate sitting cross-legged on the bed in my jammies.

And then I drove several hours from the San Luis Valley to Denver. I was really sick of driving by the time I got home, and my back hurt. It took me two trips to unpack everything, and after getting the mail I decided the car needed a bath. So I took it to the automatic car wash.

It’s nice to be home again, though I wish my vacation was longer. Not much has changed while I was gone. There’s a new homeless camp across the street, and my terrarium’s tiny succulent plant has sprouted some new leaves. Other than that, it’s the same old condo in the same old place.


Oh, I gained 8.2 pounds on my trip. I’m the heaviest I’ve been since June of 2020. I guess it’s time to go back on my diet. No more sopaipillas for a while.
