[beatallica.com](http://beatallica.com/) - These guys rock! If you’re a fan of The Beatles and Metallica, as I am, you owe it to yourself to check this band out. Beatallica writes, performs, and records music that mixes musical and lyrical elements of both The Beatles and Metallica.

No, these aren’t “mash up” songs where someone just samples different music and then mixes the sound clips together. These are original pieces that combine words and melodies from both bands. They have released 2 CDs of songs for free on their website.

Highly recommended!
