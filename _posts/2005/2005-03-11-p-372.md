[The New York Times > Washington > How to Unite Congress: Spend Billions on Projects for Roads](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/11/politics/11roads.html?ex=1268197200&en=b3e34530cc6395dd&ei=5089&partner=rssyahoo): “‘It’s estimated for every $1 billion we spend on road construction, nearly 48,000 jobs are created,’ said Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois.” - Am I the only person in this country who realizes that this type of thinking is ultimately flawed?  Taxing people who have jobs in order to give jobs to other people so you can tax them is a losing long term proposition.  It’s like leaving the refrigerator door open all day in the summer to cool down the kitchen.  And yet politicians fall back to this fallacious sound bite argument again and again.  I guess they think people just hear, “blah blah blah create jobs blah blah” and think, “Ooh, more jobs good.  I like.”
