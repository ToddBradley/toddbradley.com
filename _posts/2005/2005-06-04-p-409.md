[Johnny Cash](http://www.losthighwayrecords.com/e/cash11403.html) - Wow, this music video just gave me goosebumps. It goes with a Nine Inch Nails song that Johnny Cash recorded about 6 months before his death. If you have any clue of what the song’s about and know anything about Mr. Cash’s life, I’m sure you’d agree this is a very powerful song and video.
