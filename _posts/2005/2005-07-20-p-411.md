[G.M. Posts Third Straight Quarterly Loss - New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/20/business/businessspecial3/20cnd-gm.html?ex=1279512000&en=bb7055248f796b24&ei=5089&partner=rssyahoo&emc=rss): “DETROIT, July 20 - General Motors today reported its third straight losing quarter as it struggles to overcome wide-ranging troubles in its home market.”
