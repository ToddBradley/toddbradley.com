## [Bradley 2005 Reunion]({% post_url 2005/2005-07-17-p-414 %})



[![](/assets/img/converted/Img0007.JPG)](../photos/reunion2005/Img0007.JPG)I’ve been lax in reporting it, but last weekend was the Bradley 2005 Reunion.  I planned it this year, and took a 4 day weekend for it.  I think everyone had a good time.  It was much more centered around activities than in some years past.


The two biggest bits of fun for me were Saturday, when we went white water rafting with Arkansas Valley Adventures in Brown’s Canyon, and Sunday, when some of us tried (and two succeeded) in climbing Mt. Princeton.


I uploaded my full size photos to the [reunion page](/).  There aren’t any captions or anything yet, but most of the pics are self-explanatory, I think.
