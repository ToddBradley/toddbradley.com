[The New York Times > Washington > Senate Votes to Allow Drilling in Arctic Reserve](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/16/politics/16cnd-arctic.html?ex=1268629200&en=751ee60394917b57&ei=5089&partner=rssyahoo): “Seven Republicans joined 41 Democrats and Senator James Jeffords, independent of Vermont, in opposing it. Those seven were John S. McCain of Arizona, Norm Coleman of Minnesota, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, Gordon Smith of Oregon and Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe, both of Maine.” - Is this the beginning of the end of the long argument over drilling in ANWR? I was happy to see McCain voted against it, at least. He continues to impress me.
