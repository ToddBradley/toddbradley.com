[Radio Paradise - eclectic online rock radio](http://www.radioparadise.com/index.php) - I discovered this internet radio station by accident a couple weeks ago, and have fallen in love with it.  I have never heard a better radio station.  They play a great mix of music, no commercials, and offer a high fidelity 128kbps MP3 stream.  One reason it sounds so good is that they have real human DJs selecting songs that go together well, just like old fashioned radio stations did (before the days of the computer-generated playlist).  Give Radio Paradise a listen.  I doubt you’ll be disappointed.
