For grins, I bought a Gemini VH-120L, which is a “dual channel wireless” microphone system with two lavalier mics. That means it’s got two clip-on microphones, each with their own battery/transmitter/receiver pack. Those transmitters connect via radio to a base station which mixes the signal from the two microphones together and sends it out a 1/4″ jack in the back. The whole thing was only $120, so I wanted to see what sort of quality it might be for that price. Well, the answer is “poor”! I don’t believe I’ve ever experienced a noisier microphone rig than this one. It’s impressively bad, and I can’t imagine offhand any reasonable application for this product. Hopefully I’ll find something someday. Otherwise, I just wasted 120 bucks.
