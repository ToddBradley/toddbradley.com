I saw my first Hummer H3 on the road yesterday.  It was, of course, near the shopping mall.  It’s noticeably smaller than the H2, which Beth thinks looks like a tank and I think looks like a small school bus.  I get a sense that GM is really grasping at straws at this point.  The H2 really doesn’t appear to be substantially different than the Jeep Cherokee or any other midsize SUV.  From looking at it, it looks like just another SUV built on a pickup truck chassis, only with four giant plastic panels that stick out over each of the wheels.  That said, it at least appears that it could be useful for offroad driving, unlike it’s bigger cousing the H2.


My prediction is that this is the end of the line for the Hummer.  I’ll bet they won’t make an H4.
