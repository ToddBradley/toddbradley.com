[iriggs blog ENTRY 1149](http://www.iriggs.com/blog/comment.php?ref_entry=1149): “She makes another quick swerve lane change and gets into the middle lane. She’s pulling up on my right side now, to give me a piece of her mind i believe. What she does not know is that a CHP unit is in the right lane. He’s been there since the 5 freeway interchange. I saw him pull on the freeway there, and i’ve been driving steady at 55 along with the rest of traffic.

She pulls directly next to me. Cell phone still on her left ear. Right hand comes across to give me the finger. At this point i have the camera already snapping shots. She’s so into giving me the finger, that she does not notice the CHP unit drop in behind her and light her up.

It was a bright day with beautiful clouds, so the pictures were not too clear of her, but there is no doubt, she’s got no hands on the wheel.”

If I still had an SUV Backlash blog, I would’ve put this there. Check out the link for the photos. Also, it turns out there’s a “Women in SUVs” blog! You can find that [here](http://womeninsuvs.blogspot.com/).
