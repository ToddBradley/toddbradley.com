## [wilderness weekend]({% post_url 2005/2005-05-16-p-395 %})

Well, I’m back from my weekend of rafting and hiking. It was much wilder than expected, and I’m still so exhausted from Saturday’s “hike” that I’m taking the day off work to recover.

On Friday, we all met and camped at the put in site, near Loma, Colorado. Saturday morning, we rafted (and, in my case, kayaked) about 3.5 miles to Rattlesnake Canyon. Most of us hiked from the river up to the arches, which was certainly the most strenuous hike I’ve been on in a few years. It was a lot of hand over hand climbing. Then, we split up, and I got lost and rimrocked. Eventually I found my way down and trudged back to my kayak, then paddled alone 10 miles in the cold until I found our campsite. Sunday, we paddled another 10 miles or so to the take out, then packed up vehicles and drove 5 hours home. Whew!

More details later, once I gather my wits and photos.
