## [Dragging Bottom]({% post_url 2005/2005-07-17-p-415 %})



[![](http://www.toddbradley.com/uploaded_images/P1010002-798985.JPG)](../uploaded_images/P1010002-703312.JPG)Yesterday, Beth and I decided to take our inflatable kayaks out  and get on some water somewhere.  Beth had never piloted her own duckie on a river before, and I wasn’t in the mood to drive a long ways.  So, based on some online research I’d done a wile back, I decided to take her on the South Platte.


We paddled the section of the river between Brighton and Ft. Lupton, which is around 9.5 miles.  There were two little rapids at dams, but the rest of it was very smooth.  The water level was so low, though, that we were dragging on the bottom way too often.  It was a bummer - a “drag” I guess, to use a pun - to get high centered on sand and gravel bars all day.  If we paddle on the Platte again, I think it’ll have to be in the spring.  Summertime just doesn’t cut it.


[Here’s a link](http://www.canoecolorado.com/trips/SouthPlatte/brighton/) to the description of the trip we took.


Man, it was a hot day!  After we got home, we took the boats apart and washed them down and I was glad to get sprayed with the garden hose.  I kept drinking nonstop the rest of the day.


Here’s a photo of Beth getting on the trip.  She didn’t want me to take it because her hair was messed up, but I think she looks hot in her life vest.  Actually, now that I think about it, I’m sure she was hot in her life vest, literally!
