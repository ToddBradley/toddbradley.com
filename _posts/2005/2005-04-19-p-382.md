I see that GM just posted a 1.1 billion dollar loss for the quarter. Wow, that’s a lot of money. I found this graphic interesting. It’s from the New York Times and shows that GM lost 2.7% market share in the first quarter of 2005, while Toyota gained 2.7% market share.

GM gives us the H2, and Toyota gives us the Prius. GM loses money, and Toyota makes money. GM loses market share, and Toyota gains market share.

I wonder if these events are related, or just random chance.
