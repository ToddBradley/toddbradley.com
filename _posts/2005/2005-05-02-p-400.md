Yes, that was some serious squish that day…

For those who may not be aware, I’m responsible for doing [the weekly “squish test” for Grass Roots Ultimate Spring 2005](/).

Well, I had to call off the games for Sunday May 1, after we’d had snow and rain all week long. Here’s a photo I took of part of Field 1. You can faintly see a white circle on the grass under this small pond. That’s where the cone marking the right front of the end zone is supposed to go. If we’d tried to play that day, a good chunk of the endzone would have literally been underwater.

Note, I uploaded the photo at full original resolution, so it’s kinda big. For those with dialup connections, I don’t recommend clicking on the “Very Squishy!” link above.
