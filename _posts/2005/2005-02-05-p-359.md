## [Tax Time]({% post_url 2005/2005-02-05-p-359 %})



I’m going crazy doing taxes.  I always hate doing the taxes.  And they’re that much worse this year because we owe several thousand dollars, so I want to make sure to eke out every legally possible deduction.  That’s what I’ve been doing this morning, and I’m sick of it, so I guess it’s time to switch to some other boring household chore, before I take a shower and go work.  Strange that the highlight of my Saturday is shaping up to be a trip to the office to catch up on my job.
