It looks like the federal government’s response - or lack thereof - to the Hurricane Katrina disaster is going to become a major political issue. Before I forget, I just wanted to jot down how strange it felt to me to read the news on September 1 that our President had to cut his month long vacation short to attend to crisis management, and that the nearest thing he came to being there was to ask his jet plane to “fly low” on the way from his Texas mansion back to his Washington mansion.

I felt disappointed that anyone would think that getting only 28 days of a 30 day vacation was a sacrifice, and I felt disappointed that the best he could do was look out the window at the remains of New Orleans rather than setting up a command post in Louisiana and taking charge of the situation.
