[Let them sing it for you](http://www.sr.se/p1/src/sing/index.htm)

This is insanely cool. Some guy in Sweden has taken pop songs and cut out individual words of dialogue, and then written a web application that pieces those words back together to “sing” text that you input. This is the sort of thing I’d love to do if I had infinite free time.
