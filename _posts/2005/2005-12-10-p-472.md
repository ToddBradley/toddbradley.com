Beth and I spent two evenings this past week taking Red Cross CPR and first aid courses.  I’ve taken them before, twice.  But it’s been about 10 years since the last time, I think, and you’re supposed to do them every year to stay current.  Tuesday night was CPR and we were there for about 5 hours.  Thursday night was first aid and that only took about 3 hours.
