[The End of Movies : Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/displays/the-end-of-movies-110880.php): “Now, the IFC Center has curtians over the screen. They rise up when the movie starts. They show a short film before the main attraction. There are no commercials. Theres a nice cafe. Even if the movie didnt float your boat, you still feel like youve been somewhere. The IFC is well-rooted in its community, the digs are nice, and you get still get Sno-Caps. Theres a reason Barnes and Noble is doing so well, and its not the books. Its because they make the process of choosing a book comfortable. This, in turn, encourages more book-buying.”


I’ve been wishing for a theater like this for some time.  I hate going to see a movie in a “mainstream” (meaning AMC, around here) theater, only to be forced to sit through 30 minutes of still picture advertising (for lasik, new subdivisions, and Coke) followed by 5 minutes of motion picture advertising (for new movies, and - once again - Coke).  I’ve been wondering - out loud, no less! - why they can’t just show short films before the feature, like they did 50 years ago.  Too bad I don’t live in New York.
