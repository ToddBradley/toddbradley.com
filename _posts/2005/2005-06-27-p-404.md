## [two plays in two days]({% post_url 2005/2005-06-27-p-404 %})

Last night, Beth and I went out on a date. First was dinner at [Taigun](http://disoriented.typepad.com/sushipilgrim/2004/12/broomfiel_co_ta.html), which is our favorite Japanese restaurant in Broomfield. They’ve changed their menu a little and everything we had was quite good. Then we went to see “[Saint Joan](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200811h.html)” as performed by [The Upstart Crow](http://theupstartcrow.org/) in Boulder. It was long, with two intermissions, but good. I worked some on the play in a technical role, helping put together props, so they offered me a “comp” ticket but I refused, and paid full price instead. I really didn’t feel like I’d earned a free ticket, although in hindsight I did work around 6 or 7 hours on the play. That’s nothing compared to the time you put it in you’re really working on the play but seems like enough for a free ticket, maybe.

Anyhow, today we went back to Boulder to see “[The Tempest](http://www.allshakespeare.com/tempest/)” as performed by the [Longmont Theater Company](http://www.longmonttheatre.org/). It was set as a B-movie science fiction story, which errily paralleled the “Space Monster on Danger Beach” play that the Conviviality crew is working on this summer. It was a free performance, outdoors in the plaza next to the [Dushanbe tea house](http://www.boulderteahouse.com/). And, of course, it rained on us. So they took an unexpectedly early intermission and continued after the rain stopped. I really liked the set and costumes they put together, highly inspired by Star Trek. The actors’ performances were more consistently good than Saturday night’s Joan performance, and Beth definitely liked Tempest more.

I can’t think of another time when we saw two plays in two days.
