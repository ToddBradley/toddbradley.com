[Cellphone Headset Use Isn’t Safer for Drivers - Yahoo! News](http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=2026&e=2&u=/latimests/20050712/ts_latimes/cellphoneheadsetuseisntsaferfordrivers): “A study of cellphone use by motorists suggests that they aren’t any better off using a headset in the car than holding the phone to their ear: They’re still four times more likely to end up in a crash and injured than if they weren’t using the phone.”


This study confirms what I’ve suspected for years.  I’ve got friends and coworkers who insist that using a headset on their cell phone while driving is just as safe as not talking on the phone at all, but my “gut feeling” has always been otherwise.  What I am surprised by, though, is that the risk is 4 times as high when talking on the phone.  I suspected it would prove to be 50% higher or maybe 100% higher, but not 300% higher!
