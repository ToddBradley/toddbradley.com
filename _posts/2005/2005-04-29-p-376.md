[Woodpecker Thought Extinct Rediscovered - Yahoo! News](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050428/ap_on_sc/woodpecker_found): “Interior Secretary Gale Norton said, ‘Second chances to save wildlife once thought to be extinct are rare. … We will take advantage of this opportunity.’”

I’m not sure what to think of that. Coming from Gale Norton, I suspect the part she was thinking but didn’t say was, “…and when I say ’save wildlife’ I mean ’save’ as in ’save stamps’ - that is, capture them and put them in a drawer.” Maybe I’m too tough on Gale Norton. But can you fault me for it?
