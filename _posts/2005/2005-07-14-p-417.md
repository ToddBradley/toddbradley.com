Here’s the initial announcement for the play I’ve been working on:

Prepare for Blastoff to the 1960’s B-Movie Outer Space:

“Space Monster on Danger Beach”

Saturday, August 13th, 7pm @ The Dairy Center

The Conviviality Community Theater and Entertainment Co. presents its annual summer theatre production and will be launching its performance of “Space Monster on Danger Beach” for ONE night only at the Dairy Center for the Arts on Saturday, August 13.

This original, multi-media production stars your favorite Conviv regulars, plus some new members to the fold. Put this as a MUST-DO on your calendar!

Due to space limitations (we’re in a REAL theater!), thiswill be a first-come/first-served arrangement. Doors open at 7pm and the show starts promptly at 7:30pm. Suggesteddonations are $5-20/person to help cover some of the expenses. EVERYTHING is funded by those performing andcreating this production. Convivial libations will be provided in the theater.

Party with the cast after the performance at the HQ.

More details to come…

See you there or you could be really square!The Always Ready for Conviviality Players
