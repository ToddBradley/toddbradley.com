Tuesday was Election Day, of course. Here in Broomfield, we had 8 questions on the ballot. Out of those, 4 of the ones I voted for actually won! Given how seldom my candidates historically win, 4 out of 8 is pretty outstanding! Of course, 2 of those races were ones for school board where the person was running unopposed. So 2 of my4 winners were “gimmes”.

It’s nice to see that Referendum C passed. I voted for that one. I figure any time my dad and my wife both agree on anything related to politics, it’s probably got merit. That was the case with Ref C this year.
