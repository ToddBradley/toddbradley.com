I guess it is. Importing my blog articles from blogger.com went relatively nicely. Any comments left through Blogger are lost, though. But that’s no big deal because nobody ever leaves me comments anyhow.

And I got switched over to use my new email server, too.

Now, I just need to move over the static content (like the TFC map page) that I want from my old site. But I’m going to let a lot of it go, along with most (maybe all) of my photos. I don’t think anyone ever looks at my online photos anyhow.
