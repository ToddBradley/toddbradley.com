Well, it’s Halloween eve. I worked late and then went to the rec center to work out, so I got home around 7:45 or so. Beth was at Krav Maga class, so when the doorbell rang a few minutes after I got home, it was up to me to answer it.

I opened the door, fully expecting to see one or more costumed children doing the old Halloween thing. Instead, there was a single 6 or 7 year old girl, dressed in blue jeans and a sweatshirt. She had a big bag in her hands.

I said “hello” and she replied “hi”. There was a long, awkward pause as I waited for her to should, “Trick or treat!” But she didn’t, so I thought I’d prompt her.

“May I help you?” I asked. That got another awkward pause.

“Do you have any candy?” she asked. Then I noticed that there was a van out in the street, with lights on and the engine idling. Apparently, whatever parent or guardian she has who didn’t teach her the right way to go trick-or-treating also couldn’t even be bothered to walk around the neighborhood with her. The best they could do was drive her from house to house and wait in the van while she awkwardly asked for candy.

“Yes,” I answered. “Would you like some?”

“Yeah,” replied the little girl. I ended up giving her a rice krispy treat, and felt sorry for the kid for the rest of the night.
