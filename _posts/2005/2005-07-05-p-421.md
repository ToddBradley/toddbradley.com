[Treehugger: Permadeck boards : Fantastic Plastic ?](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2005/07/permadeck_board.php) - Here’s what we need.  Beth and I were sitting in Mark’s hot tub last night before the Nederland firewords.  And we both agreed we’d like a hot tub.  Building one into a new deck made from this sort of stuff would be awesome.  As soon as we have $10k to blow.
