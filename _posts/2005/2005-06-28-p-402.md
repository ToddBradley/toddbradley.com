## [playing on the swingset]({% post_url 2005/2005-06-28-p-402 %})



I’m subscribed to the Broomfield freecycle email list.  If you don’t know what freecycling is, you should learn!  See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freecycle_Network).  Anyhow, someone named Mary just posted this ad yesterday.  It left me reeling.


My husband just graduated from university and has not yet found a job.As such, if anyone has a swingset or fort type thing that they haveoutgrown, we would truly appreciate giving it a new home.  Thanks, Mary.


I’m trying to figure out what Mary is getting at.


Is her husband a Super Doogie Howser who graduated from university at age 8 and now wants a swingset?


Or is he an adult who is so dejected from being unemployed that he has retreated into his inner child and wants to play in a “fort type thing”?


Perhaps she’s trying to find something for her out-of-work husband to do with his time, and installing some playground equipment seems like a good idea.
