![Broomfield Independent Film Series announcement in the Broomfield Enterprise](/assets/img/converted/FirstAnnouncement.jpg)


There it is.  The first public announcement of the Broomfield Independent Film Series.  We wrote up a press release and I sent it to the Broomfield Enterprise so they could put it in their announcements section.  We’ve already gotten one local director who inquired about submitting a film, thanks to this newspaper announcement.


[Here’s the series’ website](http://www.broomfieldfilm.org/), in case you have no idea what I’m talking about.
