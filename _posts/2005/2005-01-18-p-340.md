[HOT AIR: Postal Experiments](http://www.improb.com/airchives/paperair/volume6/v6i4/postal-6-4.html): “Helium balloon. The balloon was attached to a weight. The address was written on the balloon with magic marker; no postage was affixed. Our operative argued strongly that he should be charged a negative postage and refunded the postal fees, because the transport airplane would actually be lighter as a result of our postal item. This line of reasoning merely received a laugh from the clerk. The balloon was refused; reasons given: transportation of helium, not wrapped.” - Here’s the funniest web page I’ve seen all day.  I’m at work reading this, and trying not to laugh.
