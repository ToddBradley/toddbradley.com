## [mid week mini weekend]({% post_url 2005/2005-04-06-p-387 %})



I’m taking today off from work as a “vacation at home” or “mental health” day or whatever.  At the moment, I’ve got more things on my mind that I need or want to do at home, than at work.  It’s the between-project slump at the office, and even though I’m supposed to be part of 3 different projects, there’s almost nothing I can do on any of them at the moment.


So, I’m going to stay home today and file my state income taxes, catch up on bills and email and crap like that, and then do some writing on “Space Monster on Danger Beach”.  By the way, that’s the play I proposed the Conviviality players to perform this summer.  They ended up choosing it, and put me in charge as director and head writer.  So I’m going to be a playwright much of the next 2 or 3 months!
