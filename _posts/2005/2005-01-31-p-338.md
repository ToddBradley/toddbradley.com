[The New York Times > International > Middle East > Defying Threats, Millions of Iraqis Flock to Polls](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/31/international/middleeast/31iraq.html?oref=login&th): “Voters in Shiite and Kurdish areas turned out in especially large numbers, and at the day’s end election officials here estimated that the nationwide turnout could exceed 60 percent. The turnout in the Sunni-dominated areas like Falluja and Mosul, where the guerrilla insurgency rages and where many Sunni leaders had called for a boycott, appeared to be substantially lower.”

Now wouldn’t it be ironic if turnout for the elections in Iraq ended up higher than the [60.7% turnout](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=414313) in our own US election?
