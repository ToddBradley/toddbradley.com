[Boing Boing: Sims-style anti-teen-pregnancy ad from Belgium](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/23/simsstyle_antiteenpr.html) - This is pretty good.  As Boing Boing says, “This is a very clever anti-teen-pregancy ad produced by the Belgian health authority (inexplicably, it is in English). The advert uses animation in the style of The Sims to depict a teen mom being run off her feet and gradually losing her shit completely — funny and sobering at once.”  It got me to thinking why we never see the US government funding interesting ads like this.
