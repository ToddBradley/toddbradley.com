Literally hours after I made the post about CNG being such a great deal at $1.88 a gallon, I went to fill up the Honda and found that they’ve raised the price to well over $2.00 now. As far as I know, nothing has happened in the past week to justify a significant increase in natural gas prices. I’ve been told much of our CNG comes from right here in Colorado, where hurricanes and terrorism shouldn’t have any impact on the price. I suspect it’s just good old, down home price gouging by Clean Energy. Hey, since gasoline prices are so high, let’s raise the price of natural gas, too!
