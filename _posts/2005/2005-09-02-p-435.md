[Gasoline Prices on Yahoo! News Photos](http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&ncid=1756&e=1&u=/050901/480/gagb10409010035) - Wow, $6 a gallon is a bit hard to believe, but here in Broomfield gasoline prices are now just over $3 a gallon. Compressed natural gas (CNG) is relatively a better deal than ever at the moment. Even though it keeps going up in price, it’s at $1.88 a gallon. Usually it’s about $0.50 less than gasoline, but right now it’s more like $1.20 less than gasoline. It’s times like this I appreciate having a car that runs off CNG. All my fuel is produced in the US, and much of it is from Colorado. So my transportation costs are pretty isolated from the Middle East war-du-jour and hurricane. Beth’s aren’t, though. She told me last night that it cost $50 to fill the tank on the pickup (which is what she drives 90% of the time).
