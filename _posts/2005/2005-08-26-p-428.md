## [A Busy Month]({% post_url 2005/2005-08-26-p-428 %})



Wow, it’s been a month since my last blog entry.  You might think from the lack of activity that nothing interesting has happened lately, but it’s just the opposite.  In the past month I have:


Finished co-writing my first ever full length play


Directed my first ever play


Traveled to New York for a wedding where almost all the men wore kilts


Played a weekend-long Ultimate Frisbee tournament and re-injured my knee


Dropped out of summer league and fall league (as a player)


Put on the end-of-season GRU Summer League tournament, marking the end of my duties as League Coordinator


Started catching up on everything that’s been piling up during my period of intense busy-ness
