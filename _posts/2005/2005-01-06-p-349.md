[Fabric Labels](http://www.cleaning101.com/laundry/fabricsymbols2.html) - Are these symbols clear to you?  Beth bought a new bathrobe that had several of these on the label and couldn’t figure out what they meant.  My guess (before I looked at this handy cheat sheet) was that the bathrobe should not be cleaned with nuclear waste, nor put in a square box, nor get wet, and that it’s kosher for Passover.
