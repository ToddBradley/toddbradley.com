[Amazon.com: Music: With Teeth [EXPLICIT LYRICS]](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000929AJQ/qid=1115611873/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/104-7728129-4289541?v=glance&s=music&n=507846)


I see Nine Inch Nails has finally released their (his) new CD.  Wow, it’s been 6 years since the last one, the 2-CD “The Fragile”.  I read a few of the reviews of this new one on Amazon, and it’s now on my wish list.


One review, strangely, implied that “The Fragile” was hard for most of the group’s fans to appreciate.  However, I’ve got to say that for my money, “The Fragile” was Trent Reznor’s masterpiece.  With one exception - a track on CD 2 that I don’t think fits in at all with the rest of them - “The Fragile” is one of my favorite concept albums ever.


(ps. If you can figure out what song I’m talking about on CD 2, leave me a comment.  But I doubt anyone will.  I haven’t met anyone who appreciates the brilliance of “The Fragile” as much as I do.)
