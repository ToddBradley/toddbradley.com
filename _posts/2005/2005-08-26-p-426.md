[Wildlands Restoration Volunteers | Projects](http://wlrv.org/wrv_projects.htm#LeftHandCanyon) - If you’re in the Boulder area on September 10 and want to do something nice for the surrounding wildlands, consider this volunteer project. Wildlands Restoration Volunteers is a local non-profit that fixes up places in the Boulder that have been overused - by foot or vehicle traffic, mainly. They do trail restoration, reseeding, planting, etc. I’ll be helping with the [Left Hand Canyon project](http://wlrv.org/wrv_projects.htm#LeftHandCanyon), as well as the [St. Vrain State Park Wetland project](http://wlrv.org/wrv_projects.htm#SVSP). You’re not likely to find a better group of folks anywhere, and it feels good to fix up areas that have been trashed by other people.
