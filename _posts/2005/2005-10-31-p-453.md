## [Visual TFC Map Guide]({% post_url 2005/2005-10-31-p-453 %})

tfcmaps/Well, I moved over the screen shots from Team Fortress Classic that made up “|30+|Dr. Ebola’s Visual TFC Map Guide” on my old website. They’re now a photo album in [Gallery2](http://gallery.menalto.com/) here on my new site.

By the way, I’ve just been using it a few days, but so far I’m quite pleased with Gallery2. It’s an open source photo management system that does a lot of what [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) does, but doesn’t cost anything. It took a while to get it integrated well with [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), but it’s working pretty well now.
