I’m not sure if I’ve said this before, but the recent political uproar over confirming Bush’s already-rejected judge nominees reminds me…


I believe that if churches and church organizations are going to get directly involved in politics, they should lose their tax exempt status.By “directly involved” I mean spending a significant amount of their time lobbying, telling their members who to vote for, running ads that attack members of one political party or another, etc.


That said, [Focus on the Family](http://family.org/) is not a tax exempt organization (donations to it are not deductible on your federal taxes).  And that’s a good thing.  That means that, like the Sierra Club, they can legally do extensive political lobbying, which they have certainly be doing!
