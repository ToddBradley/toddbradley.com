I was chatting with my little brother online this evening, and telling him a little about [cohousing](http://www.cohousing.org/). I wrote something about [neo-cons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservatism_in_the_United_States#Neoconservatism_and_American_area_studies) not being likely fans of cohousing. He wrote back, “I wonder if you’re a neo-con if you have to google the term when your brother mentions it.”

So he looked up the definition and turned me on to [this quiz](http://www.csmonitor.com/specials/neocon/quiz/neoconQuiz.html).

I took it. It’s got hard questions! My own person results were that I’m a “realist” which is defined like so:

> Realist
> Realistsâ€¦

    * Are guided more by practical considerations than ideological vision
    * Believe US power is crucial to successful diplomacy - and vice versa
    * Don’t want US policy options unduly limited by world opinion or ethical considerations
    * Believe strong alliances are important to US interests
    * Weigh the political costs of foreign action
    * Believe foreign intervention must be dictated by compelling national interest

Historical realist: President Dwight D. Eisenhower
Modern realist: Secretary of State Colin Powell
