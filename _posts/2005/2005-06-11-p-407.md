I’m a bachelor once again this weekend.  Just me and Rufus Poofus Underfoot.  I took myself out for some Mexican food for dinner and then came home and watched [“Swingers”](http://imdb.com/title/tt0117802/combined) for the first time ever.  This is a great movie!  I was inspired to rent it after listening to a recent review of it on [Reel Reviews](http://www.reelreviewsradio.com/), one of my favorite podcasts.
