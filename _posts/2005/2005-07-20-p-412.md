## [When Did We Lose The Space?]({% post_url 2005/2005-07-20-p-412 %})

It has been brought to my attention that modern American English grammar no longer requires two spaces after the period at the end of a sentence. One space is considered correct nowadays. Every sentence I’ve typed for the past 20 years has ended with two spaces, and that’s a lot of sentences! In fact, hitting the space bar twice after a period is so engrained in my motor memory, that I’m not sure I can resist and only enter a single period. When did we lose the second space in our language? It’s like I just learned after all these years that I’m adopted. I’m so confused and disoriented…
