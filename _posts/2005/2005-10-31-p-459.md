If you’re a frequent reader of my blog, you might remember that I re-injured my right knee in late July.  I was playing Ultimate Frisbee in a benefit tournament, and I guess I just overdid things.  Well, after I realized something was seriously wrong, I took it easy for about a month after that.  Then, when things didn’t improve, I went to my doctor.  She prescribed ice and an anti-inflamatory for a month.  Those didn’t help either, so I finally went to see the knee specialist, the same one who operated on me a couple years ago when I screwed it up in the first place.


Well, after an x-ray and an MRI, Dr. Schneider says I have a cyst growing in the bone and a tear to my meniscus.  The first one sounds like a recurrance of one problem I had originally, though the second part is new.  Neither one go away on their own, so I’m going to have to have another knee surgery at some point.  Right now I’m thinking of putting things off until early in 2006, so I’m not dealing with rehab, crutches, and limping during the holidays.
