[NASA - Cassini-Huygens: Close Encounter with Saturn](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/main/index.html) - “All these worlds are yours, except Europa. Attempt no landings there.” A player from my Ultimate Frisbee team this past summer said she’s working on a space probe to go to Europa. I told her that’s a bad idea, but I don’t think she cares. Cassini’s not off-limits, though.
