## Lac Amora WiFi

If you’re in the area of Lac Amora Park in Broomfield, Colorado, you may be within range of my wireless access point. It’s broadcasting on channel 9, but access is restricted by MAC address. If you’re in the area and would like to use my wifi, drop me an email at [todd@toddbradley.com](mailto:todd@toddbradley.com).
