## Journal Archive 2000 to 2002






October 2, 2002: I’m thinking about resurrecting the
    [suvbacklash](http://www.suvbacklash.com/) website.  You see, 
    I was interviewed by a reporter for USA Today last week.  She was 
    writing this article about the SUV backlash (though she didn’t use that term 
    exactly) and wanted some extra background material.  None of my 
    interview was used in the article, but the article did turn me on to the 
    fact that there’s more activity on the anti-SUV front than I was aware of.  
    I thought for a few moments about building it as a Manila site, but now I’m 
    thinking that if I do resurrect it, I’ll just keep it in FrontPage.  In 
    other news, I’ve developed an interest in learning more about ethical 
    relativism.  I’ve been reading on the web about it some, but have 
    failed to find a really good book that surveys arguments for and against.


September 24, 2002:  I just finished putting 
    some more wedding related photos up on the site.  They’re the ones of 
    the Friday and Saturday before the wedding.  See them and others on the
    [wedding photo page](/).


September 22, 2002:  In reviewing my photos from 
    the honeymoon, I’ve made [an astounding discovery](/).


September 19, 2002:  Geez, where do I start?  
    Let’s see.  The wedding on September 1 went nearly perfectly.  
    Then we spent two weeks in Hawaii for our honeymoon.  You can see 
    photos and my travelogue [here](../photos/wedding/honeymoon/).  
    Today I went back to work for the first time since August 29.  Wow, 
    what a shock!


August 21, 2002: The big catch up.  Since I 
    haven’t been keeping this updated, I figure there’s a lot to write about.  
    Here goes.


Wedding Plans.  It’s now less than two weeks 
    until Beth and I [get married](/).  I thought we 
    had everything squared away until I realized we still have about 20 things 
    on the To Do list between now and then!  I won’t go into any more 
    detail since you can learn all about the wedding on its own page.


404 Not Found. 
    [The band](http://www.404notfound.net/) has been busy lately.  
    We did a photo shoot a while back at Lakeside Amusement Park.  We’ve 
    played a few gigs here and there, but not steadily, unfortunately.  I 
    bought a BOSS SP-505 desktop sampler, which I’ve used at a couple of 
    performances so far.  It’s OK for the price, but has a few 
    shortcomings.  You can see my thorough review of it
    [here](http://www.synthsite.com/synth_reviews/boss_sp505.cfm).


Bats.  Back in July, I went on a very fun field 
    trip with the Colorado Bat Society.  We visited the Orient Mine in the 
    San Luis Valley in southern Colorado.  There, we saw the largest colony 
    of bats in the state.  I wrote up a pretty thorough
    [photo journal](http://www.coloradobats.org/orient.htm) of my 
    trip.


More Photos.  I bought a digital camera this 
    summer.  The main reason I wanted one was to take to Hawaii with us on 
    our honeymoon.  But I’ve made pretty good use of it in other ways.  
    For instance, I took a lot of pictures of my bat trip (see above) and some 
    of the [pre-wedding barbecue party](/) we 
    had in early August.  After the honeymoon, I should have lots of 
    pictures to share with you.


Mini Cooper S.  Ever since March (see my March 
    24 journal entry below) I’ve been thinking about test driving a MINI Cooper 
    S.  But they apparently don’t have any available at the
    [Colorado dealership](http://www.ralphschompmini.com/) yet.  
    I sent them an email and they never wrote back.  Lousy marketing!


Digital Video.  My band
    [404 Not Found](http://www.404notfound.net/) recorded a couple of 
    30 minute TV segments for Denver Community Television (DCTV).  It’s a 
    show called Innervision TV and the sound quality was so bad on the first 
    one, we went back to tape another show.  Anyhow, I have videotapes of 
    both performances, which I bought from the host of the show.  I really 
    wanted to be able to show the videos to other people on the website, but I 
    didn’t have the equipment to digitize a VHS tape into any computer format.  
    After some research, I found that Mike’s Camera in Boulder will transfer VHS 
    to DVD for $80 an hour.  Since this was going to be just under an hour 
    (two half-hour shows) I thought about that for a while.  But then I 
    found that you can buy a USB device to grab video for anywhere between $40 
    and $150.  So I thought, "Why pay someone $80 to do it when I can buy 
    something for the same price?"  So after researching a lot of these 
    solutions, I bought a Pinnacle LINX.  It plugs into an RCA video and 
    left and right audio in one and and a USB port on the other side.  And 
    it comes with software to grab video.  Admittedly, it’s not full TV 
    resolution (640 by 480).  In fact, it’s half that, but I figured that’s 
    good enough, for two reasons.  First, if I want to show this online, it 
    has to be low res.  Second, the video is fairly crappy to begin with so 
    having it at lower resolution won’t hurt anything.  Anyhow, since 
    trying out this new device, I’ve found that it consistently locks up my PC 
    every time I record video using it.  Not instantly, but after an 
    insidious delay of anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes.  After crashing my PC 
    (which runs Windows XP and isn’t ever supposed to crash) a few times, the 
    Microsoft crash agent thingy suggested I update my video driver.  So I 
    got the latest NVIDIA GeForce driver and installed it.  When I did 
    that, then suddenly my PC would then lock up consistently within about 2 
    minutes of starting Windows!  Boy that’s frustrating.  So I went 
    back to the old video driver.  Windows doesn’t crash anymore.  
    Except when I try to capture video.  I wonder if I should buy a 
    Macintosh.  I definitely want one of the new iMacs with the big screen.


Recommendations.  I recommend reading 
    Interface by Stephen Bury.  That was my summertime sci fi book, I 
    guess.  I hope to take more fiction on my honeymoon with me, but most 
    of my [backlog of books](/) is nonfiction.  I’d also 
    recommend Paris to the Moon.  We’ve seen lots of movies this 
    summer, but the ones I most recommend are The Bourne Identity (maybe 
    just for the very strange two or three lines of non sequitur 
    dialogue) and Cable Guy (which I watched on DVD and was surprisingly 
    impressed with).  I had a dream about [Milla Jovovich](http://www.millaj.com/) last night, so I may have to rent Resident Evil. 
    (I’ve secretly loved Milla since Chaplin, though it 
    was her role in The Fifth Element that really cemented her forever in 
    my heart along with
    [Gena Gershon](http://www.geocities.com/Paris/LeftBank/7614/gershon/gina.html) and [Madchen Amick](http://www.chez.com/madchen/).)


Finally, I just can’t get over the impression that Donald 
    Rumsfeld ("Mr. Secretary") looks a lot like Richard Couch ("Mr. 
    Bankruptcy").

Did I ever tell you the story about
    [Richard Couch’s Gay Son](http://www.diablomanagement.com/Couch2.htm)?


August 21, 2002:  Ok, I’ve been getting more 
    feedback that people actually read this thing.  For instance, just 
    yesterday, I got an email from a guy in Poland who wrote:



> 

> BTW: I visited your website and read your online 
            journal 
![:)](/assets/img/converted/icon_smile.gif)
  It’s interesting to know how life in the USA looks like.


So, I guess I need to spend some time bringing readers up to 
    speed.  I’ll try to catch up soon.  Maybe tonight.  If not, 
    it’ll have to wait until the weekend.


July 19, 2002:  One person emailed me to say he 
    read the online journal.  Thanks Perry!


May 27, 2002:  Wow, I’m getting good at only 
    updating this once a month.  [Email me](mailto:todd@toddbradley.com) if you actually read this.  Otherwise, I won’t update it 
    more often.


April 27, 2002:  I’ve spent most of my spare 
    time in the past two weeks building a new PC.  It’s been way more of an 
    ordeal than I expected.  I’m not new to building homemade computers, 
    but this one has been one of the most challenging ever.  I wanted to 
    replace Sponge and Mollusk, my old Windows XP and Linux machines, with a 
    single top of the line machine and a hardware firewall/router.  The 
    whole setup finally works, but I learned some hard lessons.  Here are 
    the top three:


* Windows 98 will not boot if you have a CPU of 2.2 GHz 
        speed or faster
* Windows 98 will not boot if you have more than 1 GB of 
        RAM
* GeForce 4 video cards are incompatible with SOYO P4S 
        motherboards

March 24, 2002:  My birthday was the 20th and we 
    had a party.  Lots of people came and I got many nice gifts.  But 
    nobody bought me [one of these](http://www.miniusa.com/), 
    unfortunately.  I had heard they were going to make Minis for sale in 
    the US again, but I forgot about it until I saw a billboard along I-25 last 
    night that said "THE SUV BACKLASH STARTS NOW".  That’s one of their 
    many marketing slogans.  It was particularly interesting to me, since I 
    once owned the domain name suvbacklash.org and suvbacklash.com.  
    When I got home, I went to check out the Mini USA website and then checked 
    the domain registration for suvbacklash.com.  Turns out that 
    nobody else has picked it up since I let my registration lapse after I shut 
    down the site.  So, I registered it.  Again.  Maybe there is 
    going to be an SUV backlash after all.  Of course, you wouldn’t know it 
    from the actions of our Congress, who just voted to cancel the improvements 
    to the CAFE standards.


This past month, 404 Not Found has been rehearsing lots and 
    we started our [Spring 
    2002 performance series](http://www.404notfound.net/performance.htm).


Also, the wedding planning has been coming along.  We 
    now have:


* a date and time - 6 PM September 1, 2002
* a location - Boulder Theater
* an officiant - Gail Boex
* a caterer - A Spice of Life and Erika from Sushi Zanmai
* a DJ - A Music Plus
* rings - seen [here](images/rings.jpg)
* a guest list - lots of folks
* invitations - printed up and sitting in a box

And I even started a [wedding web page](/).


February 18, 2002:  It’s been a month since I 
    wrote anything here.  And I doubt anyone even noticed!  The past 
    month has consisted of lots of work work, lots of music work, and lots of 
    wedding planning.  Today’s a holiday for me - the first time I’ve had 
    Presidents Day off since 12th grade, I think.


January 19, 2002:  Whew, it’s been busy lately!  
    On top of work (which has been hectic the past week), I went to the health 
    club Monday night, had the online CD release party for 
[Nightmare Lullaby](http://www.404notfound.net/lullaby.htm) 
    on Tuesday night, a test team management workshop Wednesday night, and our 
    weekly Deadlands game Thursday night.  So last night (Friday) we just 
    stayed at home and watched [The Hurricane](http://us.imdb.com/Details?0174856) with Denzel Washington.  It was a decent show, 
    but nothing amazingly outstanding.  I also spent all night until nearly 
    1 AM working in the [recording 
    studio](http://www.404notfound.net/a7arl.htm).  I’m trying to get it ready for Scott and Rich to come over 
    this afternoon.  We’re going to plug a bunch of audio devices in 
    together and see what kind of noise we can generate.  Basically, this 
    is some experimentation and rehearsing for our first live performance, which 
    will be [next week](http://www.404notfound.net/performance.htm).  
    Later this morning, I need to go shopping and get some various gear to make 
    things go a little smoother in the studio.


January 11, 2002:  Did I mention I finished 
    reading 
[Culture Jam](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0688178057/qid=1010849464/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_7_1/103-5310434-2906259)?  It’s a good book and I recommend it.


January 5, 2002: Wow, it’s a new year.  There 
    have been only 3 things in my life the past week - planning our wedding, 
    working, and finishing the new [404 Not 
    Found](http://www.404notfound.net/) CD.  It’s done, by the way.  It’s called
    [Nightmare Lullaby](http://www.404notfound.net/lullaby.htm), 
    after the spoken word piece of the same name by
    [Scott Siders](http://www.404notfound.net/about_scott.htm).  
    I’ve been planning an online CD release party, and if you happen to be 
    reading this and have not gotten an invitation yet, please consider 
    joining us.


December 29, 2001: In case you haven’t heard, 
    Google’s extensive [USENET 
    archive](http://www.google.com/grphp?hl=en) is
    [finally online](http://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html).  It represents 20 years of Internet history, dating
    way back before there was a World Wide Web.  It’s great to see 
    all these articles being preserved for posterity.


Just for grins, I did a search for myself to see how far 
    back I could trace my online history.  Turns out that
    [my very first USENET article](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=author:Todd+author:Bradley&hl=en&as_drrb=b&as_mind=12&as_minm=5&as_miny=1981&as_maxd=29&as_maxm=12&as_maxy=1990&rnum=2&selm=29337%40boulder.Colorado.EDU) was posted on November 6, 1990.  I 
    thought it would have been earlier than that, but I guess not.  That 
    was my 9th and final semester as an undergrad at the University of Colorado.  
    In December, I would graduate with a BS in Aerospace Engineering Sciences 
    and then in January I’d start graduate school.  Here are some other 
    funny subjects I was involved in all those years ago:





August 9, 1991

[My mail order bride want ad](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=author:Todd+author:Bradley&start=860&hl=en&rnum=863&selm=995%40pvi.UUCP)
I was looking for someone who could cook and 
                clean plus take over my job at PVI writing Fortran code.  
                Note my self-assumed title of Supreme Ruler of the Galaxy.


February 24, 1992

[First mention of the woman who would become my life partner, 
                Beth Partin](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=author:Todd+author:Bradley&start=780&hl=en&rnum=785&selm=1992Feb24.060535.26793%40ucsu.Colorado.EDU)
I had been dating Beth for less than a month 
                when I posted this.  I guess I’ve gotten used to kissing 
                someone with glasses!  Also note that by this time I was 
                signing my name as "Todd." which is something I still do to this 
                day (any of you who have ever gotten an email from me know this 
                to be true).  
                Also, notice the fake middle name "Slan" in my signature:


Todd "Slan" Bradley-Postmodern Reaganomics Renaissance Man, 
                The Exception to Every Rule, An Example To All Men, The Biggest 
                Jerk In The World, Supreme Ruler Of The Galaxy, AND Captain of 
                The Unnamed Computer Science Ultimate Frisbee Team.***




November 11, 1992

[On the Dynamics of Rotating Sport Discs](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=author:Todd+author:Bradley&start=680&hl=en&rnum=689&selm=1992Nov15.224528.1247%40ucsu.Colorado.EDU)
This is the paper I wrote to get a Masters 
                degree at CU.  To this day, many people don’t believe me 
                when I say I got a Masters Degree in Aerospace Engineering by 
                studying the flight of frisbees.  Here’s proof.



***  If you’ll forgive a tangent for a moment, each of 
    the items in my signature has a history, and I’ll explain them now:


Slan: I once got a letter from CU addressed to Todd 
    Slan Bradley.  My middle name’s Alan, and S is just one letter away 
    from A on the keyboard, so someone clearly made a typo when entering that.  
    I thought Slan sounded like a cool, Slavic name and so I used it as a 
    pseudonym for a while.


Postmodern Reaganomics Renaissance Man: A coworker of 
    mine at Precision Visuals named Matt Powell gave me this title one day.  
    He was impressed at the amount of computer and non-computer trivia I knew.


The Exception to Every Rule:  I wish I could 
    remember the context, but I’m pretty sure that Jaye Lampe gave me this name.


An Example To All Men:  Hmm, I can’t remember 
    where this came from.


The Biggest Jerk In The World: In high school, I had 
    a friend named Daren Deffenbaugh.  His sister Julie called me this one 
    day when I was bugging her about something or other.  The title stuck 
    in my mind because it’s such an absolute.  If I can be better at 
    something - anything - than the other 6 billion people on the planet, that 
    makes me feel pretty good.


Supreme Ruler Of The Galaxy:  When I lived in 
    Libby Hall at CU, one of the other guys on our floor was a very soft spoken 
    fellow named Bill.  When anyone would ask him what he wanted to do when 
    he graduated, he’d always say he wanted to become a king.  He was 
    totally serious about it, too.  And so I figured if Bill can aspire to 
    be a king, I can aspire to even greater power.


Captain of the Unnamed Computer Science Ultimate Frisbee 
    Team:  Even though I wasn’t a Computer Science student, I hung 
    around with lots of them.  I somehow got elected to captain their 
    Ultimate team, and I think the team was later named "The Flying Bitheads".



December 27, 2001:  Christmas has come and gone!  
    I got some nice gifts and for the most part had a quiet day at home.  
    My parents visited from Thursday through Sunday, and Beth and I spent 
    Christmas day just the two of us.  I worked the day before and the day 
    after, while most of my coworkers took those days off.  For Christmas, 
    I got several CDs, a couple DVDs, two GURPS Traveller books, some toys, and 
    some money to buy more toys.  Don’t know what I’ll spend the 
    money on, yet.


We went to see the long awaited Fellowship of the Ring 
    movie on opening day last Wednesday.  And we liked it so much, we went 
    to see it again on Christmas.  It’s a great film and is now voted as 
    the #1 movie of all time by readers of IMDB.com.


I’ve been making good progress mixing the next 404 Not Found 
    CD.  I made the first test CD and made lots of notes about how it 
    sounds on various equipment.  Now it’s back to the studio to remix some 
    tracks and remaster others.


Here’s an idea I had a long time ago, that I’ve been meaning 
    to write down here.  This came to me while I was driving home from my 
    parents house at Thanksgiving in my NGV.  
    One of the most important features of this car is that it has incredibly low 
    emissions, a point that’s accentuated when driving over the mountain passes 
    on the highway along with all the diesel trucks and SUVs that pour out 
    smelly black and blue clouds for miles and miles.  I was thinking the 
    gasoline companies should research fuel additives that give off various 
    designer scents when burned.  I imagined a special gasoline that 
    smells like milk chocolate when it burns.  That would sure make 
    highway driving in traffic a lot more pleasant!


Perhaps part of what made me think of that was an article I 
    read about a guy who has a car that runs on leftover fry oil from 
    restaurants.  He says that the car puts out fumes that smell like 
    wherever the oil came from.  So if he gets used oil from a chicken 
    joint, his exhaust smells like KFC.  Or other times, it smells like 
    fresh french fries.  Even if it’s not chocolate, that sounds nicer than 
    the usual burning diesel smell.



December 15, 2001:  Well, Christmas is nearly 
    here.  I’m almost done with my shopping and may finish the rest up this 
    weekend.  We watched The Avengers last night on DVD.  It 
    pretty much sucked.  Maybe I’d like it more if I were a fan of the 
    original TV series.


My pet peeve of the day is for-profit companies that don’t 
    read and reply to their email.  This has happened to me twice in the 
    past week.  First is the Harry Fox Agency, a company that licenses 
    songs written by one person for use in a recording by another.  They 
    have a website and a customer service email address for questions, but a 
    week after sending them a question by email, they still haven’t responded.  
    The other time this happened to me this week is with a company called 
    Colorado Weddings, which - as you may have guessed - organizes weddings in 
    Colorado.  They also have an email address, to which I sent a note 
    requesting more information on north Denver venues they work with.  
    Still no response.


Speaking of email, last week my hatred of spam email finally 
    came to a head.  I realized that well over 50% of the mail I was 
    getting was spam, so I shut down one of my email accounts that was the 
    source of a lot of it. I can no longer be reached at
    [ToddBradley@bigfoot.com](mailto:ToddBradley@bigfoot.com).  
    Originally, the Bigfoot concept seemed great.  Their tagline was "Email 
    for Life" and the idea is that you’d get one email address that you could 
    use forever, and it would just forward messages to you at another address.  
    So, you could have it point at your home ISP email and then if you switched 
    ISPs someday you just point it to the new one.  Well, eventually 
    realizing they didn’t have a viable business plan, Bigfoot started making a 
    requirement that if you were going to use their "free" email for life 
    service, you have to accept advertisements delivered to your mailbox.  
    In the end, I wasn’t willing to do that, so I canceled my service.  
    Also, I looked at a number of anti-spam programs and settled on one called 
    Spam Eater Pro, which I purchased.  It filters out spam messages using 
    two different methods - checking senders’ addresses with a number of 
    anti-spam services (like ORBS and RBL, two of the most famous) and also 
    filtering based on regular expressions in the header and body.  Between 
    those two methods, it’s doing a good job of deleting my spam before it ever 
    gets to me, and it only cost $25.



December 2, 2001: I just finished a massive two day 
    project to revamp the photos section of this site.  My photos from my
    [October 2001 vacation](../oct2001/oct2001_page1/) are finally 
    up, along with notes of where I went.  Plus, I put several scans of old 
    pictures on the site.  You can find it all from the main
    [photos page](/) now.


Last night, Beth and I went to see Amelie, a French 
    film that’s incredibly funny and good.  It’s playing at the Mayan in 
    Denver.  We’re still looking for a place to have the wedding, and 
    haven’t seen the perfect location yet.



November 28, 2001: I finally got my photos back from 
    Snapfish.  The prints are of standard quality, but what I’m really 
    impressed with is the digital versions.  The computer files, delivered 
    on CDROM, look really, really good.  They make me look like I’m a real 
    photographer, rather than some schmoe with a 15 year old point-and-shoot 
    camera.  I’ve already taken one of the photos and put it up as my 
    desktop on my PC at home.  I’ll go through them all and do some 
    cropping and touchups, then incorporate them into my October 2001 travel 
    log, which is a work in progress.  More on that later.



November 25, 2001:  Last week was a pretty short 
    one for work, but still very busy.  I had Thursday and Friday off for 
    Thanksgiving and drove to my parents’ house for the holiday.  There, I 
    met up with Beth, who had been on the Hopi and Navajo reservations as part 
    of the Traditional Support Caravan.  My aunt invited us to Thanksgiving 
    dinner at her cafe in Redstone, which was very nice.  I took my cousin 
    Billy along with me and saw lots of other relatives.  It snowed a 
    couple times while we were there.


We drove back Saturday so that I could make it to Scott 
    Siders’ book release part at Stella’s coffee shop in Denver.  He read 
    some pieces from his new book and did a little duet performance thing with 
    Josh, who also played with a musical group.


Now I’m home trying to get caught up on things - bills, 
    email, etc.  Also, I’m going to start Christmas shopping.  But 
    before I do that, I’ll update my online [wish list](/).



November 12, 2001:  I spent all day yesterday 
    (Sunday) playing Ultimate.  It was the fall league tournament.  My 
    team played four games, from about 9:00 AM straight through to about 2:00 
    PM.  We won the first one, lost the second, won the third, and lost the 
    fourth.  That first loss put us in the "beer bracket" which we didn’t 
    win, unfortunately.  But it was good fun.  I haven’t played 4 
    games in a single day in over a year, so I was fairly tired and sore, but 
    not as bad as I expected.



November 10, 2001:  I just got home from the 
    movie theater.  I went with my friend Mike to see The One, the 
    new Jet Li movie.  It’s gotten terrible reviews, but I was actually 
    impressed with it.  I was expecting a real stinker, but this was a good 
    movie, given that you understand the genre it comes from.  It’s got 
    great effects and sound, good action and fight scenes, and even a decent 
    (though not very original - but who would expect such a thing) plot.


Earlier today, my Ultimate Frisbee team had our final 
    practice of the season.  Tomorrow is the big tournament, and I guess 
    we’re about as ready as we’re going to be!


I sent five rolls of film to Snapfish this week and 
    requested prints and a CDROM.  So once those come back, I’ll put some 
    of them on my website.  The photos are mostly from my vacation to Utah 
    three weeks ago.



November 3, 2001:


I’ve now been running
    [Windows XP](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/launch/) for over 
    a week and it hasn’t crashed or locked up on me once!  That’s about 5 
    to 10 times better than Windows ME was.  And I found that T[eam 
    Fortress Classic](http://tfc.pcgame.com/info.html) (TFC) runs better than ever before.


The plot with the car accident last week thickens.  The 
    kid who ran in to me filed a claim against my insurance.  The insurance 
    inspector (claim adjustor) took recorded statements by telephone with both 
    of us and denied the kid’s claim because she felt I was not at fault.  
    So, that leaves me with two choices.  I could either file a claim on 
    the other driver’s insurance and hope they find him to be at fault (in which 
    case I don’t have a deductible to pay), or I can just forget it and file a 
    claim on my collision insurance (in which case I have to pay a $500 
    deductible).  Well, I did the first one and then found out from the 
    other driver’s insurance that he is an "exempted driver" for the car that he 
    was driving.  So, they will be denying my claim based on that.  
    But to me that sounds like he was driving without insurance, which is a 
    fairly serious crime in Colorado!  So now I’m not sure what’s going to 
    happen next.  Will my insurance company take him to court?  Will 
    they ask the police to arrest or ticket him for driving without insurance?  
    We’ll see.


Let’s see.  What else happened this week?


Well, Monday night Beth and I went to Sushi Zanmai’s annual 
    invitation-only party.  It was at the former JC Penney location in the 
    nearly dead Crossroads Mall in Boulder.  We got in with no problem, and 
    then stood in line for nearly two hours to get some of the free sushi that 
    was the main appeal of the party.  Yes, free sushi!  Then when we 
    were about 10 people from the front of the line, finally, they ran out of 
    sushi!  So, after spending the whole night standing in line starving, 
    we decided we’d had enough of this "party" and went to Sumida’s for 
    supper.


Halloween was Wednesday night and we had a pretty low 
    turnout of kids, which means we’ve got lots of candy left over.  
    Thursday night I watched 
[The Tao of 
    Steve](http://www.spe.sony.com/classics/taoofsteve/above4.html) on DVD; I really liked that movie and would recommend it.



October 29, 2001:  As always, I have a ton of 
    news since I last wrote.


First off, I lived through my first week on the job.  
    My title is QA Engineering Manager and I guess they liked me so much on my 
    first day that they gave me a second group to manage on Day #2.  So now 
    I’m overseeing two software QA teams, and I’ve got a lot to learn about the 
    company’s products and related technology and people and everything else!  
    Everyone’s great and I’m very excited and happy to be at
    [Voyant](http://www.voyanttech.com/).


Last week, I upgraded my home PC called Sponge to Windows 
    XP.  So far, I’m very happy with it.  It hasn’t crashed once, 
    which is much better than Windows ME.  Unfortunately, XP wasn’t 
    compatible with my sound card, my tape backup drive, or my printer.  
    So, I bought a new sound card, took out the tape drive and am just doing 
    archives to a secondary hard drive, and traded printers with Beth.  Now 
    it’s running smoothly and everything’s happy.  Oh, I had to upgrade my 
    Norton SystemWorks to the latest version, too.  Version 2001 wasn’t XP 
    compatible for 2002 is.


I still haven’t made any progress on writing a travel log 
    about my vacation, but I will.  Beth and I watched a few episodes of 
    Sex and the City on DVD over the weekend.  It’s a famous show that 
    we never saw because we didn’t have HBO until recently.  It’s fairly 
    funny.  I can’t say it’s my favorite TV program, but it’s nice to have 
    a 30 minute TV show without commercials.


Yesterday (Sunday the 28th) my Ultimate Frisbee team played 
    our next to last game of the regular season.  We won easily against the 
    juniors team, made of a bunch of teenagers who are all in the same church 
    group.  One more game, which should be a bit tougher, and then the 
    tournament!


Finally, on Friday (the 26th) as I was driving home from 
    work, I got in the first auto accident of my whole life.  Some 16 year 
    old kid borrowing his brother’s sports car rear-ended me at a stop light at 
    Sheridan and 120th.  I didn’t call the police, thinking it would be 
    nice to cut the poor kid some slack, but now I’m regretting it, because he 
    denies responsibility for causing the accident.  Having a police report 
    would probably be a good thing, although I can’t imagine how the insurance 
    company or a court would find that I caused the accident, since I think they 
    almost always consider the rear-ender to be at blame over the rear-endee.  
    Luckily nobody was hurt.  My own suspicion is that the boy was driving 
    too fast for conditions, paying only marginal attention, and trying to 
    impress his girlfriend in the passenger seat with how fast his brother’s car 
    could go in rush hour traffic.  We’ll see how it goes with the 
    insurance investigators.



October 22, 2001:  Wow, there’s a lot to add 
    since my last journal entry.


First off, I just got back from being out of town for a 
    week.  I left on October 11 for Salt Lake City, where I attended the 
    annual conference of the Glen Canyon Institute.  It was on Friday and 
    Saturday and I just barely made it there on time, because I drove and the 
    roads Friday morning in southern Wyoming were a mess due to some snow, low 
    temperatures, and extreme wind.  Then, I took the "scenic route" back, 
    stopping in Canyonlands and Arches National Parks for some camping and 
    hiking.  I stopped for a day at my parents’ house in
    [Redstone, Colorado](http://www.redstonecolorado.com/) and went 
    fishing on the Colorado River on Friday with my dad.  Then, I finally 
    got home late on Friday the 19th.  I took lots of photos and am 
    planning to write up a whole travelogue once I get the pictures developed 
    and scanned.


The other big news is that I start a new job today.  
    Unfortunately, the consulting business I put so much heart and soul and 
    startup money into just hasn’t taken off the way I’d hoped.  And I need 
    to start paying the bills.  I had heard about a company called
    [Voyant Technologies](http://www.voyanttech.com/) from a guy I 
    worked with at Jabber and he said it was a great place.  So, I talked 
    to them some.  They had a software QA manager position open and it 
    sounded like a very good opportunity.  From what I can tell, the 
    company is very sound, they have a good product for which there’s lots of 
    demand, and - best of all - the people are great and really seem to know 
    what they’re doing.  So, they convinced me to come join the team.


While I was on my trip to Utah, I ended up buying some more 
    camping gear, too.  The best thing is a really cool day pack from REI, 
    with a Platypus "hydration system" in it.  Maybe I’ll tell you more 
    about that in a later entry.  Gotta go to work now.



October 6, 2001:  Last month, I refinanced the 
    mortgage on our house.  I paid off the existing mortgage plus the car 
    loans for my 
    and Honda Civic GX with a new loan from 
    the [University of Colorado Federal Credit 
    Union](http://www.uofcfcu.com/) at a much lower (and fixed) rate.  Other than having monthly 
    payments of about $800 less, one other benefit is that I got a big fat 
    refund check from the feds for a bunch of mortgage insurance I’d paid (since 
    the previous loan was from FHA and required mortgage insurance).


So, with the check from the Department of the Treasury 
    filling my pocket, I decided to go on a shopping spree and buy some outdoors 
    clothes and equipment that I’ve wanted for a long while.  I got:


* [Columbia hat](http://www.columbia.com/products/pr_detail.cfm?product_id=48) - I’m running out of baseball caps and wanted something 
        that isn’t made of cotton.
* [Marmot Catskill sleeping bag](http://www.marmot.com/products/bags/bag_prod_hv_catskill.html) - Why do I need another sleeping 
        bag when I already have 3?  Well, one of them is a double wide for 
        summertime camping with Beth.  One is 20 years old and doesn’t 
        insulate very well anymore.  And one is a very warm mummy 
        bag that has zippers that always catch and doesn’t work well for someone 
        who sleeps on his side and rolls around a lot (that’s me).  This 
        Marmot semi-rectangular bag doesn’t have the insulation value of the 
        Cabela’s mummy bag, but it’s got an awesome zipper design, with special 
        panels sewn into the bag to prevent the zippers from catching on the 
        fabric.
* [Pacific Trail Pac 
        Tech Terrain jacket](http://www.pacifictrail.com/) - I’ve wanted a true waterproof 
        breathable shell for a long time.  I had a decent water resistant 
        shell but I gave it away and it wasn’t fully waterproof.  This one 
        is great.
* [Galyan’s](http://www.galyans.com/) brand 
        polar fleece sleeping bag - supposedly you’d use this for summertime 
        camping, but I bought it as a liner for my new sleeping bag for times 
        it’s cold.
* [HydRID LightWeight](http://www.duofold.com/thermal/hydrid.htm) long sleeve t-shirt - If you’ve never owned any 
        clothes made of [CoolMax](http://www.dupont.com/coolmax), you 
        should.  CoolMax is the most awesome fabric I’ve seen.  It 
        wicks sweat away from your skin really nicely - 5 times faster than 
        cotton, they say - but is as comfortable as cotton.  I bought a 
        pair of CoolMax underwear several months ago for wearing while hiking 
        and playing Ultimate Frisbee and when I saw a long sleeve t-shirt made 
        of the stuff, I just had to buy it.


October 5, 2001:  Yesterday, Beth and I drove up 
    to Loveland to look at a possible location for our wedding and reception 
    called .  It was a nice enough place, but didn’t seem quite right for 
    what we wanted.  We’ve got a long list of possibilities and I 
    think it’ll take weeks to evaluate them all.  At some point, we’ll make 
    a wedding web page, but we don’t have any of the details sorted out yet, so 
    it would just be blank at this point!


Next week, I’m leaving town to drive to Salt Lake City for 
    the annual meeting of the [Glen Canyon 
    Institute](http://www.glencanyon.org/).  It’s going to be a tight schedule since I have to be in 
    Boulder on Thursday night for the quarterly board of directors meeting for 
    the [Colorado Bat Society](http://www.coloradobats.org/), of which 
    I’m the Executive Director.  But the first of the events I want to 
    attend in SLC starts at 6:00 PM on Friday.  So, I’m starting my road 
    trip right after the bat meeting.  I’ll make it to Wyoming somewhere 
    and stay the night and then drive the rest of the way on Friday.  To 
    save money, I’m planning to camp.  The GCI events are over Saturday 
    night, and I’ll probably spend Sunday doing some sightseeing in Salt Lake 
    City since I’ve never been there except to pass through.  Then I’m 
    taking the scenic route back and will hopefully do some camping and hiking 
    at some of the places we didn’t have time to visit on our Utah trip in the 
    spring.  I may hit the San Rafael Swell area, Arches National Park, the 
    La Sal-to-Gateway road that I’ve always wanted to see, and then visit my 
    parents in Redstone on the way back over the mountains.


I watched episode #2 of Enterprise last night.  
    It was o.k.  In some ways, I like the show because it’s so much 
    different than the previous Star Trek television programs.  But in some 
    ways I don’t like it because it’s too similar.


What else have I been doing lately?  Always trying to 
    find new clients for my consulting 
    business.  Evaluating a diskette of new sounds for my Korg Karma in 
    preparation for writing a review.  Reading a bunch.  Shopping for 
    a new sleeping bag.  Playing and practicing Ultimate Frisbee with my 
    team Big Hair Todd and the Swillers (also called Big Huck Todd and the 
    Swillers).  Playing and practicing Team Fortress Classic with my team 
    30+ Team 1.



September 26, 2001:  I went to see
    [Chris Locke](http://www.washspkrs.com/speaker.cfm/3732) talk 
    last night at the [RMIUG](http://www.rmiug.org/) meeting.  
    He’s not as [freaky](http://www.rageboy.com/) as I expected.  
    In fact, his talk was really quite good.  I may even buy his
    [new book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204080/qid=1001535639/sr=2-1/ref=sr_8_7_1/107-3469280-0767759), though I thought
    [Cluetrain Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204315/ref=bxgy_sr_text_a/107-3469280-0767759) was a
    [bit tedious](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-reviews/-/A2YHU2LV32CKNO/107-3469280-0767759).


Also, for the past two days I’ve been immersed in my project 
    to cook [blue corn lamb tamales](../recipes/#Tamales).  
    Well, I’m finally done and they came out pretty decent for my first attempt.  
    I spent a couple hours this afternoon writing up the recipe for them, as 
    well as writing a recipe for [borracho beans](../recipes/#Borracho) 
    and finishing my recipe for [smothering chili](../recipes/#Chili).  
    They’re all on my [recipe page](../recipes/).


Tonight I’m going to watch the series premier of 
    Enterprise.


Sure wish someone would leave a note in my
    [guestbook](http://pub36.bravenet.com/guestbook/show.php?usernum=3087332100&cpv=1).  Maybe nobody reads my online journal.



September 19, 2001: I made a [Visual TFC Map Guide](/) with screenshots of the most popular TFC maps.



September 3, 2001:  I’ve been spending a lot of 
    time in my recording studio the past few days, making good progress on a lot 
    of new songs for the next [404 Not Found](http://www.404notfound.net/) 
    CD.  Also, I just scanned in an old photo of me at age 16.  Go see 
    the Todd Through The Years page [Ed. - It’s now [here](../photos/photos1/)] to see it.



August 29, 2001:  I finished another book this 
    morning.  That makes 4 I’ve finished in the past week - Cowboy Slang,
    Sun Chief: The Autobiography of a Hopi Indian, Alexander the Great 
    and the Logistics of the Macedonian Army, and Hopi Dwellings.  
    I decided it was time to go write some book reviews for Amazon.com, too, 
    which I did.  I’d like to say it’s now time for some fiction.  But 
    out of the 14 books left on my "books to read" [shelf](/), 
    13 are nonfiction.



August 28, 2001: Beth and I spent a long weekend in 
    the mountains.  On Friday we drove from our house in Broomfield to the 
    Denver Creek Campground.  Saturday, we visited another local reservoir 
    to watch birds and got ice cream in the town of Hot Sulphur Springs.  
    Then we drove to Winter Park and rode the
    Alpine Slide and saw the oompah band that was playing there for 
    Octoberfest.  Then, it was back to our camp for dinner.  Sunday, 
    we leisurely broke camp and headed home by way of
    [Rocky Mountain National Park](http://www.nps.gov/romo/).  
    On the drive home, we saw coyotes, antelope, moose, elk, and deer.  All 
    in one day!  We stopped at the Alpine Vistors Center and later stopped 
    for a short hike up to
    [Alberta 
    Falls](http://www.swparks.com/us/travel/colorado/picalberta4.html), where I asked Beth to marry me.  She agreed, and we hiked 
    back down the mountain and drove to Estes Park where we had a very mediocre 
    meal at a Mexican restaurant.  We got home fairly late Sunday night.



August 23, 2001: I added this guest book thing.  
    Leave me a note.



August 20, 2001:  Beth and I went to see King 
    Lear performed at the Colorado Shakespeare Festival on Saturday night.  
    The weather turned out to be great, unlike the show I attended last year, 
    where I got rained on.  There’s a new burger joint on The Hill in 
    Boulder, in the space previously occupied by a Korean restaurant, and before 
    that a Japanese restaurant.  It’s called Thunderbird Burgers.  The 
    burger was o.k. I guess, but about 3 times as much bun as meat.  They 
    have these huge homemade style buns.


Last night (Sunday) we went to an open mike night at 
    Stella’s in south Denver, near DU.  It was pretty good, though a little 
    bit long for my tastes.  I think 15 different people read, which was 
    about 3 times as much as I’d prefer.


Tonight and tomorrow night, we’re going bat watching, as 
    part of the Boulder County Bat Survey.  Assuming the weather’s nice, 
    that is.  If it’s rainy or windy, we’ll have to postpone for another 
    day.


Oh, I put a few photos up of
    [me on vacation](../photos/canyonlandsphotos/) this spring.


And last night I finished reading William Gibson’s All 
    Tomorrow’s Parties.  It’s probably not his best work, but 
    entertaining nonetheless.



August 17, 2001:  Today, I received an
    [interesting brochure](../rwmailer/) from a
    [former employer of mine](http://www.roguewave.com/).  There 
    seems to be a minor typo in the spelling of my last name.



August 8, 2001: After years of nagging from people 
    who want my salsa recipe, I finally put up a [recipes](../recipes/) 
    page on my website.  Check it out and let me know if you enjoy any of 
    the recipes.



August 2, 2001: My doctor says my blood cholesterol 
    level is too high, so I have to start taking medicine and eating a special 
    diet to bring things under control.  I’ve always had high cholesterol 
    and have a family history of cholesterol problems, too.  So, I guess 
    it’s good to take care of it.


I added a whole bunch of photos to the website today.  
    There are now several sets of photos all indexed [here](/).  And I’m going to scan some photos from the Canyonlands 
    vacation we took in the spring.


Also, I’ve been working on revamping the website for the 
    Glen Canyon Institute over the past week.  It’s huge!  But it 
    needs help.  And the [Glen Canyon 
    Institute](http://www.glencanyon.org/) is a very good cause.


In other news, I’ve been reading and watching a fair number 
    of movies lately, which is a good thing to do when unemployed.  
    Unfortunately, due to lack of money, I’ve had to put soaring on the back 
    burner.  So, I canceled my membership with the Mile High Gliding Club.  
    It was a sad thing to do, but I just don’t have the money for glider rentals 
    so it doesn’t make sense to pay the monthly dues to the club.  
    Hopefully I’ll be able to get back into it someday.



July 24, 2001: Did another big update on this 
    website, converting everything over to use CSS.  That’s not an overly 
    simple task in the realm of FrontPage, but it’s done!


As I wrote in my journal entry a couple weeks ago, I’m 
    starting my own company.  I just sent the paperwork off today to the 
    Colorado Secretary of State and the IRS.  The company is Zang Spur Consulting LLC.  I’m 
    setting up a website for it, but it’s still very much under construction.  
    I’ve been spending the past several days writing a business plan for myself 
    to serve as a guide over the next few months.


You might be asking yourself, "Where does the name Zang Spur 
    come from?"  Well, here’s the story:


> Why Zang Spur Consulting?  
        Well, I needed a name and I wanted something with some geographical 
        significance.  It turns out that in the 19th century, the town now 
        known as Broomfield, Colorado was called Zang’s Spur.  
The name comes from the farmer who 
        lived here, Adolph Zang.  He convinced the local railroad to build 
        a rail spur out to his farm, to make it easier for him to get his goods 
        to Denver.  So, that rail spur was known as Zang’s Spur and the 
        township that formed up around it got the same name.  Sometime in 
        the 1890’s the name changed to Broomfield, after the fields of broom 
        corn grown here.
I didn’t like the ’s in Zang’s 
        Spur, since it made the name tougher to spell and didn’t yield a nice 
        internet domain name.  So I dropped the ’s and stuck with Zang 
        Spur.
The City of Broomfield did the same 
        on the sign for Zang’s Spur Centennial Park, which now simply reads "Zang 
        Spur Park".



July 13, 2001: I moved all the best SUV Backlash 
    website content over here [since moved].  I 
    just don’t have the energy or time to keep up
    [www.suvbacklash.com](http://www.suvbacklash.com/) anymore, and 
    the backlash that I predicted doesn’t really seem to be coming after all.



July 13, 2001: It’s Friday the 13th.  I’m happy 
    to say that no more bad things have happened to me since my last entry.  
    My ankle’s mostly healed.


I am officially unemployed now, and should be collecting 
    unemployment insurance before long.  Jabber.com, the software startup 
    where I’d been working for the past year, gave me an insultingly low 
    severance pay of 2 weeks salary, which ran out last week.  I can’t 
    really blame them for including me in their layoff; it’s hard to justify 
    having a high paid customer support manager when you don’t have any 
    customers.  Clearly, the original expectations of having a viable 
    product in late 2000 and customers lining up at the door were grossly out of 
    line.  But I do hope things turn around for them.  They’ve got the 
    start of a great product and some good people.


Moving on to bigger and better things, I’ve decided to take 
    this opportunity to do something I’ve been talking and thinking about for 
    four years now - start my own consulting practice.  My new company is 
    called Zang Spur Consulting.  It’s an independent consulting practice 
    specializing in customer support and quality assurance consulting to 
    software organizations.  Most of my time the past three weeks has gone 
    to trying to learn how to set up a business like this - legal and financial 
    concerns, finding clients, etc.


In personal news, I attended the wedding of my cousin Megan 
    and her new husband J.J.  It was in Redstone, CO on July 1, and was a 
    very nice ceremony.  I got to see both of my brothers (Matt and Kent) 
    at the same time, which is rare.


Also, I’ve gone soaring a couple of times.  Earlier 
    this week, I made my first solo takeoff without a "line boy", meaning that I 
    hooked up my own tow rope and launched without a wing runner.  That 
    same flight was my first solo flight where I did any significant soaring, 
    gaining a few hundred feet of altitude in a squirrelly thermal over east 
    Boulder.



June 20, 2001: Man oh man what a week it’s been.  
    On Saturday I nearly broke my ankle by stepping into an ugly hole while 
    running around around in the desert.  On Tuesday, I got a notice that 
    the check I wrote to the United States Treasury for my estimated tax payment 
    bounced.  So, I’ll get to pay the bounced check fees and the late tax 
    payment fees.  And today (Wednesday) I got laid off from my job.  
    What else does Lady Luck hold in store for me?



June 12, 2001: Oh, where do I begin
      with the news?

First, the regular season for Spring League Ultimate
      Frisbee is over.  My team, Adverse Reaction, won our final game of
      the season.  In fact, we only won the first game and the last game,
      and lost all the rest.  But I caught the winning point of the last
      game!  So that made me happy.  Then we went to Wahoo’s for food
      and margs.


Beth and I have volunteered to help with the Boulder
      County Bat Survey again this year.  The first bat watching trip was
      last night.  We’re monitoring Stearns Lake again this year.  We
      only saw one bat, but I heard at least two on the bat box.  It was a
      little breezy, but that didn’t seem to deter the bugs.


I bought a new musical instrument last week.  It’s
      called a [Korg
      Karma](http://www.korg.com/gear/info.asp?A_PROD_NO=KARMA).  It’s a synthesizer keyboard with a number of special
      functions to help with improvised music.  It’s the most expensive
      keyboard I’ve ever bought (even on sale) and I didn’t really budget to buy
      a new keyboard this year.  So, now I’m selling off a bunch of [older
      music stuff on eBay](http://members.ebay.com/aboutme/todd@toddbradley.com) in order to raise the money to make up for this
      new toy.  Unfortunately, I’ve been so busy the past week that I’ve
      only been able to play it for 3 or 4 hours.


Also, I upgraded our internet connection.  Since
      about a year after we moved into this house, I’ve been using ISDN. 
      Unfortunately, it’s expensive - $75 a month for service from Qwest plus
      $50 a month for my ISP.  But, since our neighborhood doesn’t have DSL
      or cable internet, ISDN was my only option for a high speed
      connection.  Well, now there are other alternatives.  The one I
      chose is [MHO
      DirectWave](http://www.mho.net/service/wireless.asp), which is a wireless broadband connection.  It
      operates via a microwave dish on the roof and costs just $60 a month for
      service (for 1 megabit up and down) including ISP.  So, I’ll
      be saving about $65 a month and getting around 8 times the connection
      speed.  What an improvement!


The weather has gotten nice enough (finally) that I’ve
      resumed my glider lessons.  I took one last weekend and one the
      weekend before, with one solo flight each time.  Now I need to spend
      some time taking the practice exam in anticipation of getting my private
      pilot’s license.


My group of [gaming
      friends](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/toddsgames) is now onto a new game.  We started playing [GURPS
      Traveller](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/traveller/) a few weeks ago.  I hadn’t played (or refereed)
      Traveller for about 12 years, so it’s been a relearning experience for
      me.  The campaign I’ve put together is called [The
      Dark Wing Missions](http://www.geocities.com/darkwingmissions) and is a merchant campaign with some space opera
      style drama and intrigue (eventually) thrown in.  I’m definitely
      helping keep Steve Jackson in business as I’ve already bought 8 or 9 GURPS
      Traveller products!


Man, that’s a lot of news!  Better make the font
      smaller and move the old stuff off to the archive…

April 7, 2001: You’re
      probably wondering why I don’t update my web page more often.  Well,
      I set up a weblog site for myself, [http://tbradley.manilasites.com](http://tbradley.manilasites.com/). 
      But it’s so slow as to be painful to use.  So maybe I should
      just write my thoughts here more often.

The weather’s been getting warmer and nicer.  It’s
      really windy today, but I’ve been taking my Xootr to work more often
      lately.


Also, it’s not new news anymore, but I upgrade [my
      recording studio](http://www.404notfound.net/a7arl.htm) a while back and added a recording booth called a
      Whisperroom.  It’s nice.  So, I’ve been spending a bit more time
      making music lately.

April 1, 2001: April
      Fool’s day.  We lost our frisbee game today, but drank a lot of
      margaritas.


March 25, 2001: Ultimate
      Frisbee season started today.  I’m playing in the B league of Grass
      Roots Ultimate.  My team is B-2 and we’re called Adverse
      Reaction.  We won our first game.

March 20, 2001: In case
      you didn’t know, my birthday marks the first day of spring.  Beth
      took me to Gasho of Japan for supper, and then we went home to watch a
      movie on DVD.  I’ve been watching lots of classics on DVD and I
      highly recommend [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/).





December
      7, 2000:  I finally made my first solo flight in a glider! 
      I took the day off work to get in some glider lessons.  After four
      flights with my instructor, John Campbell, I took one by myself.  I
      expected to be very nervous, but wasn’t.  In fact, it was nice to fly
      around without someone chattering nonstop in the back seat (just as he
      told me it would be).  Here’s the traditional Polaroid photo of me
      right after landing.  [Click](images/First%20Solo%20(big).jpg)
      for a bigger picture.

October 2000:  I’m now scooter enabled.  I
bought a [Xootr](http://www.xootr.com/xootr/default.asp) [Cruz](http://shop.xootr.com/xootr/cruz2.asp)
and am now trying to learn to ride it.  If you’d like to buy one,
      [ask
me](mailto:todd@toddbradley.com) how I can easily save you 5% on the purchase.

September 2000:  I’ve upgraded my two PCs and I’m
trying to build a third to run Linux.  Unfortunately, I’ve had quite a few
problems simply ordering parts!  Read [this](/)
to see why I recommend you stay away from Advanced Design of Kentucky.


Summer 2000:  Well, I’m learning to soar.  You know, flying a
glider.  Yes, a plane with no engine.  I started taking soaring
lessons in the spring of 2000.  Progress is slow.  I’m a terrible
student, but I’m keeping with it.  I’ve been learning at [Mile
High Gliding](http://www.milehighgliding.com/) in Boulder.  Here’s what the glider port looks like right
now [Ed. - link doesn’t work anymore].
