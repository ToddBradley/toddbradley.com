  text: Good thought.  Maybe the bat’s fluids were not all disappeared? During cooking.  Don’t
    know if virus has an upper level temp above which it cannot survive ?

  text: The whole thing was that it was a “wet market” where live animals are sold
    for food.  So could be the bat was alive (like a lobster in a tank) and inspected
    and breathed on people, then (butchered?) and cooked and eaten.

  text: A quick googlin’ suggests the bat eating is apocryphal and there isn’t a clear
    indication of where the virus came from.  It wouldn’t be the first time this has
    happened with China, look at the MSG scare.
