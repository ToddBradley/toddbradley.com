    Hi there,

    Thank you for your message.

    The claimant has reviewed your dispute and reaffirmed its claim to your

    video. Specifics of the policy applied to your video are in the Content ID

    Matches section of your YouTube account at:

    http://www.youtube.com/my_videos_copyright

    Please note that YouTube does not mediate copyright disputes. If you wish,

    you may resolve this issue directly with the claimant at

    pmontoya@rebelwaltz.com

    We are unfortunately unable to assist you further.

    Regards,

    The YouTube Team

    ——

    So I emailed the claimant:

    ——

    Hi, Paris.  I got your email address from this automated response from YouTube.  They
    said you’re the claimant of a copyright dispute for a YouTube video I uploaded
    a few months ago.  Could you explain to me the grounds on which you feel my license
    to this piece of music (Nine Inch Nails-26 Ghosts III) is invalid?  I paid for
    the music, was granted a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license, and have followed
    all the terms of that license.  Are you disputing that I purchased that license,
    that the music was licensed under Creative Commons, or that my use of the music
    follows the terms of license?

    Thanks,

    Todd.'

    company for musical groups), wrote this back to me:

    Hello Todd,

    With the Creative Commons license you are free to use the track and share your
    work as you wish so long as no one is profiting from the use.  Null Co., as owner
    of this recording, retains commercial rights – this includes a claim to the audio
    related portion of the associated advertising revenue stream within YouTube (as
    calculated by YouTube’s algorithms, based on usage within the work).  That is
    the only claim being made in regards to your video.

    Best,

    Paris Montoya

    Rebel Waltz, Inc.

    And I wrote back two messages, one this morning and one this afternoon:

    —-

    1:

    OK, thanks for writing back.  So how does that differ from if I didn’t buy a CC
    license to the music?

    —-

    2:

    Or maybe more to the point: Who was profiting from the use?  I sure wasn’t; I’ve
    never made a dime from this video.  And YouTube wasn’t profiting because there
    were no ads on the video…until you asked them to put ads on it.

    Do you see my point?  Before the ads went on the video, the video was a non-commercial
    public performance, which is exactly what your company licensed me to do under
    the BY-NC-SA.

    Cheers,

    Todd.'

    account, but I never monetized this video.

    YouTube appears to have been putting ads on it against my knowledge, and has collected
    $0.11 so far. I got a copyright claim, I disputed the claim and they rejected
    that. Paris Montoya contacted me by email telling me to release my claim (what
    does that mean, YouTube doesn’t allow me option like that) by a certain date or
    they will issue a takedown notice.

    I’m within my rights to use it in the manner I have, and I have even offered to
    send the Null Corporation a sum equal to 100% of the revenue YouTube has earned
    from the video (even though I haven’t seen any of that money personally) and I
    have had no response from the Null Corporation.

    I’m stuck between an advertising company’s automated processes (Google/Youtube)
    and a profiteer. What’s the point in releasing something as Creative Commons if
    you won’t honour the licence?'

    text: 'Yup, exactly. I doubt Trent Reznor had any idea of what a mess this would
      be when he had the idea to release some of his music as Creative Commons. And
      I doubt he really gives a damn to try to sort it out at this point.

      The important thing to realize is that it is in both the artist’s and Google’s
      best interests to keep this system just as it is. They’re both making ad revenue
      from your video, and even though your part is tiny, it’s better than nothing
      and it adds up when you multiply it by millions of users. If you don’t like
      it, you’re welcome to put your video on some other hosting side - your own,
      or another company’s (like Vimeo).'
