  text: I also loved the little Burger King taco website.  I was wondering if the
    Fair Oaks was in Texas.  I have friends that live in Fair Oaks…it is just outside
    of San Antonio.  Seems like the area that would have tacos at a BK.

  text: 'Bette, to your question, the prairie chicken viewings are going on for 2
    more weekends.  The Wray Chamber of Commerce guy said they always sell out, so
    I don’t know if there are any reservations available anymore.  To find out for
    sure, you should give them a call:

    Betty, to your question, I have no idea if the Burger King taco website owner
    is in Texas.  It wouldn’t surprise me.  However, I had tacos at the Burger King
    right here in Broomfield a couple years ago.  They didn’t taste like real tacos
    but they were tasty nonetheless.

    And what are the odds that I’d get blog comments from someone named Bette and
    someone named Betty?  Maybe that should be the mandatory math question!'

  text: 'I actually rather liked the BK taco’s!

    The prairie chickens are so cool. Reminds me of heading to RM National Park in
    mid September to watch the bull elk and moose. Too bad we didn’t know about the
    “chickens” earlier, it would be something right up Rick’s and my alley for a weekend
    getaway!'

  text: Great blog, son.  I could almost hear the booming and see the feet pounding.  The
    ritual of course is the same for others in the prairie chicken family, including
    the sage grouse, that I used to see a lot of in Wyoming.

    don’t do the fast little dance with their feet like the prairie chickens do.
