  text: Thanks, everyone.  One of the strange things about this is that Beth isn’t
    in any pain, and looks and feels and acts like she always has.  She doesn’t appear
    to be sick in the slightest, so whatever is going on inside her, its being very
    stealthy about it.

  text: Todd and Beth, we here are speechless.  Jessica called this morning and asked
    what is going on.  I am very glad she did, or I would still be as clueless as
    I was before her call.  I can not tell you both how sorry I am about this bump
    in your highway!  Sending you the best “vibes” possible!
