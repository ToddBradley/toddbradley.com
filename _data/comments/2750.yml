  text: Great photos.  Thanks for the mini-travelogue.  Looks like a nice hike before
    it gets too hot.  Where were the canyon wrens?  I love their call.  Maybe delayed
    by the snow.

    text: Yeah, the temperature was perfect. It was between 68 and 72 all day. If
      the desert was like that all the time, I’d do a lot more hiking. Maybe the wrens
      were delayed, I don’t know. I don’t know what they even eat, so if they eat
      bugs, the problem may be that there weren’t many bugs yet.

  text: Beautiful this time of year before it gets too hot.  Did you see many gnats
    - it’s that time of year?  Horny toads, Gila monsters, tarantulas, or snakes?  Many
    birds?

    text: We didn’t have any issues with bugs at all - no gnats, mosquitos, or even
      flies. The only reptiles we saw were lizards, none of the other things. There
      were a few birds, but mostly ravens, magpies, and LBBs. There was a lot of beautiful
      cactus flower blooms, and all the plants - especially the Mormon tea - are flourishing
      from all the moisture the area has had this spring so far.
