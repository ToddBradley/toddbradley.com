  text: 'Todd,

    What kind of insurance do you have?  Everything has come to a standstill for me
    as the Otologist excepts my insurance (Tricare) but the Neurosurgeon who assists
    him does not. They said they would accept it but whatever Tricare does not pay
    I will be responsible for. I do not like surprises so my PC is working with the
    Otologist to see what can be done. That was 2 weeks ago and the last I heard was
    a week ago when they said they should have an answer by Friday (Jan 23). I have
    been sick in bed for 4 days so I have not tried to call but I just feel I am at
    a dead end.'

    not in any network).  So I paid him with a credit card, and now I’ll try to get
    partially reimbursed from the insurance company at the “out of network” rate.

    \ what made u pick him to do your surgery. I havent been to another physician\
    \ and think i should get a second opinion, as the prudent thing to do. To add\

    \ really helpful so thanks in advance!"
