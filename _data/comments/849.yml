  text: 'The myringotomy wasn’t nearly as bad as expected based on my experiences
    getting tubes in my eardrums about 12 years ago.  The big difference was using
    a spray-on topical anesthetic instead of something injected by needle.  The anesthetic
    needle was the real source of the pain way back when.

    Getting the debris suctioned out was uncomfortable, but not painful.  It was very
    loud!'

  text: Hi Todd, I was diagnosed with SSCD last fall and I will be having surgery
    in 11 days. I am a little less concerned about what I am about to go through because
    of you. Thank you (and Beth!) for blogging about your experience.
