    I’ve seen have been difficult for me to figure out.

  text: 'How exhausting it must be to hear every. little. thing.

    The diagram is helpful; encephaloceles aren’t common at all, are they?

    I’m glad that you’re going to be in good hands with a skilled surgeon; still,
    I’m sorry that you’re going through brain surgery again.'

    procedures was comprehensible, seeing as how I am not up to date on neurotology.

  text: Thanks, Todd, for the details so that we can better understand.  As they say,
    3rd time is a charm (well, that wasn’t true for my 3rd try for a Stone’s Sheep
    but you’re in better hands for your situation than I was).  Keeping you in my
    prayers.

  text: Thanks for stopping by, everyone, and leaving a comment. I’m writing this
    four days after the surgery, and things seem to be healing properly from what
    I can tell. The surgeon did find that it wasn’t an encephalocele as he originally
    thought, though. You can read more about that on the next article, right here.
