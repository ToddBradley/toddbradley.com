  text: Unbelievable!  I just attempted to place an order, and the OWNER hung up on
    me three times in a row.  The problem….I tried to give my name when he asked for
    the phone number for the delivery.  When I told him, I was just trying to give
    you my name and you cut me off, he hung up.  I couldn’t believe it.  I called
    right back and asked him if he just hung up on me and he said “yes.”  I asked
    him why and he said that the conversation was going nowhere.  Just so you know,
    I am a 47-year old resident of Broomfied, who happens to order pizza from time-to-time.  This
    would have been my first order with Pudge Bros., and probably not my last, but
    the OWNER blew it.  I will be telling my friends in addition to the Better Business
    Bureau (who he said, “go ahead, tell whoever you like” real sarcastically) how
    terribly I was treated.  Do not order from this place! The owner should remember,
    the customer is ALWAYS right.

      - to know that some customers are just wrong.  But I just don’t understand why
      he’d hang up on you for giving him your name.  “This conversation is leading
      nowhere” is a really weird thing for any business owner to say.  Hopefully the
      conversation is leading to a sale of his product!

      Oh well, thanks for posting your experience here.  And look on the bright side:
      Unless their pizza has really improved a lot, the owner just saved you from
      ordering what may be the most bland pizza in town.'

  text: 'I was a good customer for some time. Not because the pizza is anything special
    but because the delivery was prompt with a good attitude. One day, when I returned
    home form work there was a pudge bros. advertisement taped on my door - on top
    of the sign that says, ‘please don’t leave flyers’. The third time this happened,
    I called the shop and explained to the owner that I was a good customer, but would
    he please see to it that no more flyers were taped to my house. The asshat started
    screaming at me and really losing control. I asked him if he wanted to lose my
    business and he screamed, ‘I don’t want your business!’, promptly hanging up.

    This guy (as confirmed above) is a hot head with no self control. He shouldn’t
    be expecting any good business and I’m sure his lousy attitude will make his business
    fail.

    I recommend staying away from Pudgey.'
