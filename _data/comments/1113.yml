    from the Boulder perspective with new that Herb’s was moving OUT. I guess it’s
    the there it goes/here it comes ying and yan (or is it yin and yang? - I can never
    remember).

    Sympathies for not having an independent cafe. I was looking for one somewhere
    along US 36 to meet someone from Westminster for an interview. I only found two
    between there and Boulder — one that served coffee and tea, and did tattooing.
    The other in Superior that closed at 6 on the evening when we had an appointment
    at 7. A new business for someone??'

    text: The place that you’re thinking of that does tattooing is Bananelope Cafe,
      adjacent to Smokey Banana.  That’s the one remaining independently-owned coffee
      shop in Broomfield I was referring to.  It’s great, but I wish we had a couple
      others.

  text: I think the original Broomfield Enterprise article isn’t available online
    anymore.  But they missed their original planned move date.  I called the store
    in Boulder a couple months ago, and the woman said they’re now aiming to open
    in Broomfield in January.  I haven’t seen any activity in the strip mall where
    they said they’re going to move, though.

  text: Can you believe that I wrote this article 14 months ago and Herb’s still hasn’t
    opened in Broomfield?  Even my comment above that the owner was now targeting
    a January 2010 opening was way too optimistic.  It’s now August 2010 and they
    still aren’t open.  I read an article in the Broomfield Enterprise a couple weeks
    ago that things are stalled waiting on permits from the state health department,
    or some such.
