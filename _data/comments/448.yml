  text: My question is… I`m living in Japan and found some corn flour to make my own
    tortillas but it`s not masa. I tried to make tortillas but they stuck, fell apart
    and everybody laughed at me. I`m a graduate of the California Culinary Academy
    (1991) And to save face I have to know more about what the I have here. Please
    help me. I use to live in Ruidoso for 5 years in the late 70s. Thank you, Jim

    page, my guess is it’s either corn meal or corn starch, neither of which is masa:

    Masa has to be made using lime (not the citrus fruit, the alkaline stuff made
    from ashes).  Unless you want to make your own, which I’ve never done, I think
    your best bet is to mail order some real masa from the New World.'
