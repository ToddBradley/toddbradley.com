    what I was really getting on my plate. I like the atmoshphere, and my husband
    enjoyed the leather couch in the lounge!

    We noticed employess drinking in the bar after work and the manager seemed to
    be getting a little tipsy with them.

    We won’t go back.'

    having his friends take us there. It’s fun, the staff is usually solid and the
    food is great. I really like it when they have live music-something unique to
    the Broomfield chain scene.

    We will go back!

    have come and gone there?  And there are two similarly-sized restaurant properties
    nearby that have been vacant for well over a year.

    There are a couple restaurants nearby that have held out long term, like C. B.
    & Potts and Benihana.  But it’s a tough area for restaurants right along there.'

  text: None of these reviews really surprise me I used to work at the original vail
    location and between the brothers arguing or my co-workers being so messed up
    out of there mind on a plethora of substances I was shocked  they lasted as long
    as they did and as far as there other locations I am sure it is much of the same..
