  text: I know it’s not within your Broomfield confines, but you really should try
    Tibet’s in Louisville. It is a Nepalese/Tibetan-style restaurant, but they serve
    most of the usual Indian dishes as well. The preparations tend to be lighter and
    more fresh tasting than most of the local Indian places I have tried. They have
    a great lunch buffet every day too.

    impressed, but the food’s decent.
