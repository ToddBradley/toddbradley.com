  text: Great photos and story, thanks for sharing.  Hard to imagine how the creator
    kept this a secret for so many years; not exactly a small undertaking; in fact,
    seems he would have needed some help to put this all together.  To be honest since
    India is not on my bucket list, with the exception of the great birding in some
    areas, the Rock Wall is the best attraction you’ve reported on that I would love
    to see.

      really cared to wander back into the forest there, certainly nobody in an official
      capacity. The area was just an unused and uninhabited forest. Maybe he did have
      some help, but he worked on it as his main hobby for 18 years, so I can see
      how he’d be able to accomplish so much.
