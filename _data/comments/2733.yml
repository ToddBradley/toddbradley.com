  text: For some reason, Americans in general have never embraced the concept of eating
    hot and spicy foods when the weather is hot in order to sweat and cool off. I
    suspect our fear of sweat is at the root of it, as is the fact that my (and many
    others’) English and Scottish ancestors had little concept of too-hot weather
    or spicy food.
