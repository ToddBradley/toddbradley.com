    was the first visit for both of them, and I’m happy to report they both liked
    it!  I think they especially liked the salsa bar and getting to choose just what
    toppings went on each taco.

    Me, I had un platillo de asada.  It was good, though not great.  This morning
    I woke up in the mood for chilaquiles, but nobody would hear a bit of it.'
