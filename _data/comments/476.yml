  text: I think Ridgway is spelled without an “e”.  You know I lived there as a little
    girl.  Several movies were made (cowboy type) in that area.  When I was about
    7 yrs. old they were making “The Sheepman” and I have an old photo (I think) of
    Linda and me on the stagecoach used in the movie.  Later they made the “True Grit”
    films.  Beautiful country.
