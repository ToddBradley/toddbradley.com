    Mario Runner made it sound in his comment that his credit card company will just

  text: I work for a credit union that process fraud claims on credit/debit cards
    and prior to that i use to do credit/debit card disputes. From a financial stand
    point, our hands are tied because Visa/MC put regs and by-laws in place that the
    financial institution have to comply with. So when a bank/credit union closes
    your card for fraud. They take the lost for the amount and the cost to issue a
    new card and mail out. Most institutions 80% are not staff enough to handle the
    10k-40k cards the institution send out. As a consumer be dilgient in reviewing
    your account history on your accounts, anything questionable do research and call
    the merchant. Alot of times you are able to get credit for the charge. We cant
    stop people from stealing merchant’s database information. Its the responsible
    of the merchant to protect it.

  text: I also received a charge for $4.95 from Bestmartstore.com last month. Bank
    of America Visa credited the charge.  Then again I received another charge this
    month. Called CC Co again, disputed charge and received credit again.   B of A
    said it will take 6 to 8 weeks to resolve problem, but i will not have to cancel
    my card. I am also going to post complaints on websites mentioned on other posts.  Thanks
    to everyone who have posted there complaints regarding this bougus company.

  text: Glad this set of posts popped right up when I Googled “Bestsmartstore Com
    Llc.” Just saw the $4.95 charge when I downloaded my transactions and had no idea
    what this was. Haven’t seen - and hope not to - on our other Chase cards…I sent
    in an e-dispute form and hope all of these previous efforts will have alerted
    Chase and the others banks that this is just a fraud. Wonder whose list they got
    a hold of…

  text: 'My husbands card has been hit a couple of times now. Its through USAA not
    Chase.

    Reading through previous posts and one possible connection is government. One
    guy said he’d recently got something from the IRS and someone else said they only
    use that card for Government and another person said it was their USAA card (USAA
    while not directly government is a bank/insurance company for military personel).'
