  text: 'I have intentionally not posted the itinerary.  That’s because the itinerary
    has been intentionally been kept a secret from Beth.  I got the idea a while ago
    that I wanted to plan a trip where even the details of where and when were a mystery
    to her.  I’m hoping she’ll be able to write a couple travel articles on this -
    perhaps one on what it’s like to go on a vacation where you don’t know where you’re
    going, and another one on hot springs of the four corners area.

    I’ll post a rough itinerary after the trip.'
