  text: Having done a lot of big table checks at post-ultimate beers/dinners, the
    trick is that every person needs to figure the total amount that they owe before
    payments are made. So if I were Person A, I would have figured that I owed $72
    before the charge slip arrives.

  text: 20% tip!  Where do you live? Boulder?  The bar should pay the waitress a fair
    living wage and not expect the customer to make up for their shoddy pay scale.  Then
    the waitress wouldn’t need to worry about whether the customer can do math.  Is
    a glass of wine really worth $8 when the whole bottle is bought by the bar for
    $14?  And then that $8 becomes $9.60 with tip to the customer.  Some countries
    frown on tipping and others say 10% for exceptional service at a nice establishment
    is enough.  Americans are the most generous tippers in the world.  Too bad your
    friend “expects” tips and has to rely on them to make a decent wage.  And remember…wait
    staff shouldn’t expect a tip on the tax.

    text: I totally agree the bar (or restaurant) should pay the servers a fair wage.
      I’m not sure why they don’t. But the point here is that both the customers wanted
      to tip 20% but ended up tipping 10%. I rounded the numbers to make the example
      easier to follow.
