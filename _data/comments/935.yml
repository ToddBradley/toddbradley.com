  text: No, this is how I should have made it.  Unfortunately, I didn’t cook the veggies
    in with the noodles, and cooked the special lime/miso sauce with the snow peas.  So
    the snow peas weren’t crispy (plus, I neglected to “devein” them).  And the scallops
    didn’t get enough sauce on them, since the sauce was underneath.
