  text: 'Hi Todd,

    Thanks for the blog.  I am seeing a surgeon tomorrow in Boston.  I have a 5mm
    hole in the right and a 1.8 in the left.  My problem is the right-side causing
    heart-beat, high pitched ringing, can’t bear sounds, etc.  Also get dizzy with
    some yoga and get very tired compared to before.

    Do you have any updates on how you are feeling now?  Can you compare the two different
    surgeries you had?  Were you able to tolerate flying in a plane before you had
    the surgery (on your way there)?

    I am a little hesitant to have this surgery but was planing for a trip to Seattle
    in June (KScope) and everyone is telling me to have it before I go.

    Anyway, please keep us updated if you can.

    Thanks,

    Lisa'

      \ unfortunately nothing has changed in the past couple months. A few random\
      \ thoughts: \nFirst, the size of the holes surprisingly don’t matter that much.\
      \ Some people who have large dehiscences don’t have major symptoms, and some\
      \ who have very small ones are debilitated by it. \nAs far as how I’m feeling\
      \ now, I still have more autophony and tinnitus in the left ear than before\
      \ the surgery. My surgeon’s attitude is “hang in there, it can take 6 months\
      \ for the packing material to fully dissolve.” So I’m trying to keep a stiff\
      \ upper lip, but it does still affect me quite a bit and I can’t do some of\
      \ the things I’d like to do. \nComparing the two surgeries, the first one was\
      \ more invasive, but I recovered good hearing much faster. The second was less\
      \ invasive, and therefore has a lower chance of causing profound deafness, but\
      \ it’s been almost 4 months now and things are still worse than before the surgery.\n\
      I was able to tolerate flying just fine, both before and after surgery.\nI had\
      \ a few things planned for the fall of 2013, and intentionally waited until\
      \ they were all done before having the surgery. I wouldn’t want to travel until\
      \ 2 or 3 months after surgery. So if you’re going to have it soon, then the\
      \ Seattle trip should be fine. But if the soonest you can have surgery is May\
      \ and you have a trip planned for June, I’d postpone one or the other."

  text: Hi Todd - I am researching this problem SSCD - my daughter has finally been
    diagnosed after years of having the symptoms you describe.  Problem is she lives
    in Austin, TX and we live in Colorado Springs.  She is moving back to Denver in
    Dec.  PLEASE tell me the name of the doctors that are trying to help you.  She
    is having surgery in Austin Aug. 27th, my husband and I will be there for 2 weeks
    to help out.  BUT your blogging on this sounds discouraging kind of and she will
    take much longer to recover.  I need a dr here somewhere to help us out with this.  THanks
    so much.

    text: If your daughter hasn’t already joined, she should sign up for the SCDSsupport.org
      website. It’s the world’s largest forum of patients with SCDS/SSCD. There she’ll
      find tons of information on doctors, recovery tips, etc. You can sign up, too.
      One thing that’s there is a list of doctors who are experts in SCDS repair,
      listed by city and state (and foreign country in some cases). On the site are
      a lot of detailed journals, including my own. I have experiences with three
      ear surgeons in Denver, but none in Colorado Springs. But I know there is at
      least one expert there.

  text: How are you feeling?  My Doctor has a working theory that I have SCDS.  The
    brain fog and fatigue are killing me the most.  I have some slight dizziness,
    but I can function for the most part.  I’m currently scheduled for a CT scan,
    but my VEMP results are consistent with SCDS.  Surgery options don’t look great,
    that I can tell.  Lot of people reporting worse symptoms after surgery, including
    deafness.

    text: Well, unfortunately, my side-effects from the surgery are still in full
      effect. It’s been 11 months, and I still have bad autophony, ringing tinnitus,
      and pulsatile tinnitus. But on the plus side, I’m not dead, not paralyzed, and
      not deaf!
