  text: It’s funny…I never really think I have an accent. Yet I do. I have lived in
    NC for 15+ years now. And I have definitely adopted some more southern vernacular…but
    when I catch up with old friends my teenage years, I’m commonly surprised at just
    how similar our speech patterns are even still. Of course there are some really
    specific words, like “soda” vs. “pop”…. but the Inflections and pronunciations
    are also distinct for midwest area where we grew up. I find it striking that I
    still haven’t lost that accent…and that my old friends and I sound really similar
    still after all these years. These web sites usually peg me for Detroit right
    away…typically because of a few distinct words common to that area.

    going to try this test.  Wonder if it will think I’m from Kansas!
