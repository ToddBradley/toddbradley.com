  text: 'Interesting story about the bird poop on the shoe. I have some friends that
    describe a scam with ear wax: a guy walks up behind you and stuffs a wad of ear
    wax in your ear, then directs you to his friend who will clean the wax from your
    ear….for a price. Since most people are grossed out by a wad of multiple people’s
    wax in their own ear, most people pay to have the guy with the Q-tip clean the
    ear. You and Beth might want to keep a small stash of Q-tips on you. 🙂'

    text: I hadn’t heard that, though it doesn’t surprise me. But that makes me think
      of another strange service we got offered in Delhi, which was ear cleaning.
      I had no idea this was a thing, but I saw people getting their ears professionally
      cleaned on the street. And there are several YouTube videos showing how it’s
      done. Given everything I’ve been through with my ears, I wasn’t about to accept
      the ear cleaner’s offer, despite his little notebook of testimonials.
