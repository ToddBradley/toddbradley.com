    text: Thanks for the offer, but I have leftovers of this to last me for weeks
      (frozen). And I think I want to make a spicier and thicker gravy-style version
      next.

  text: Thank you for posting the recipe before all of the prep photos .  So many
    bloggers do it the other way.  Not sure of the little specks looking very appetizing
    but once thickened it looked great.  You have always been an amazing cook.  I
    still use your pico de gallo recipe.
