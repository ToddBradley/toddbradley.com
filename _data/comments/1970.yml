    issue: sometimes the top ply separates from the bottom ply so that your tearing
    one revolution further along on the top while tearing a revolution backward from
    the bottom ply, and the bottom ply is on top and out of alignment with the perfs
    from the other ply (I’m having trouble explaining with only typewritten words).
    Basically, the plies were separated inadvertently and they’re trying to pair up
    with a different layer. I’ve had that problem with Angel Soft before.'
