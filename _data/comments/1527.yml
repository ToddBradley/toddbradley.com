  text: Why didn’t you stop by “Trout’s Fly Fishing”?  I notice it is the only business
    listed on your map.  And I’m hoping the pho restaurant wasn’t the one with the
    public safety warning on the door.  ?

  text: 'Thanks for sharing.  Sort of like a city inside the city.  Sort of like why
    some folks like Fords and others like Chevy’s.  I guess I could ask: how many
    pristine creeks did you see?  Could you smell the pines and spruce?  Did you see
    many elk or bighorn sheep?  Was it quiet enough to hear the birds singing?  And
    how many good friends did you run across during your walk?  But I won’t.

    Its good you (and others) enjoy the urban life - leaves more of nature for the
    rest of us.  Rural life worked pretty well when there was 1/10 the current population.  I
    endured it (and enjoyed it at times) off and on trying to make a living, and it
    certainly offered more services for us raising a family.'
