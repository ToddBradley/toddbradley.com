  text: Tonight they called 48 minutes AFTER we placed our delivery order to let us
    know they we too busy to deliver our order. Could we come pick it up?? no?? why
    not?? … I mean, really. The sad part is I really love the food at this place.
    The two stars is because there are SO many similar place in the area that can
    actually complete a delivery order and are happy to do so. This is the second
    time we’ve called for delivery and they’ve not been able to. Take your chances.
