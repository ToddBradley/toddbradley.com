  text: I was smiling all the way through the post. Not a one of these things surprised
    me. I am really disappointed that the Imerex didn’t provide a better experience
    for you… and we have been past to tell them so. Many of the aspects you had trouble
    with directly relate to local culture and its relationship to time. Time here
    is still based on an agricultural awareness and not yet an industrial or post-industrial
    awareness. The concept of anything being “on time” in a western sense, is just
    foreign to the culture. The absurd engineering and lack of logic in design are
    standard here. No one is willing to take responsibility to correct problems either,
    as that would imply an insult to the person who made the original mistake. “It’s
    more fun in the Philippines” is the current slogan to attract tourists. Unfortunately
    the writer didn’t understand exactly why it’s more fun… and it’s only fun if you
    like daily challenges that do not need to be challenges.

    text: That makes sense. But I’m curious. If we were Filipinos, what would we have
      done about the laundry — just checked out of the hotel and left the unwashed
      clothes behind?
