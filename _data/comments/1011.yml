    that way sometimes. You can do FB when you feel short-tempered and blog posts
    when you feel philosophical; then we’ll all be happy.

    posts into Facebook. That way, you can share your longer thoughts here, but still
    get them in front of the folks you connect with on FB.

  text: Actually, I already solved the problem with a similar approach.  There’s a
    WordPress plugin called Wordbooker that will crosspost your WordPress posts to
    Facebook.  It’s very configurable, but I’m just using the default settings and
    it seems to do what I wanted.
