    text: Thanks. I got what may be my last unemployment check this week, but they
      shorted me one of the two weeks of money. And I read that currently Colorado
      has a queue of about 40,000 unreturned messages (phone and email) to the unemployment
      office. So I’m not optimistic about getting that money any time soon.
