  text: Todd, would be good if they are successful in Denver with the scooters.  Some
    places they’ve tried them, they had to shut system down until they worked out
    some kinks such as making it more difficult for renters to just abandon the machines.  Not
    sure how much wintery weather in Denver might have negative impact - maybe just
    use them as a 3-season machine.

    text: I think use was much lower than in the summer, but I do remember people
      riding electric scooters in the snow last winter. I’d be afraid of sliding around
      and running into something or someone - same reason I never rode my motorcycle
      in the snow.

  text: Segway riding was fun and very stable.  I have never tried the scooters, but
    would probably crash someplace, especially going over a curb.  Not sure how I
    would get my groceries home but I suppose they are essentially meant for urbanites
    that eat out most of the time.

    text: I often see people riding an electric scooter with one or two bags of groceries.
      Yesterday, I saw someone riding an electric scooter with his girlfriend holding
      on behind him, like you might see on a motorcycle. And I also saw a different
      guy on a scooter carrying his dog in his arms while riding down the middle of
      the street.
