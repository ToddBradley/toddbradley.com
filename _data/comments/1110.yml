  text: "Heaven Star is definitely one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the Denver-Metro\
    \ area. And I agree, it definitely beats having to drive to 30 miles to King’s\
    \ Land or Super Star. I never went there when it just opened. I thought it was\
    \ just some new Chinese fusion restaurant (that’s usually too Americanized - making\
    \ it extremely unattractive to Asians). My wife and I eventually succumbed to\
    \ our curiosity and tried it in March and ended up going there every week for\
    \ 5 weeks. We found the quality of the food above par and the service great! Let\
    \ me qualify. I apologize in advance for not remembering the names of the dishes.\n\
    The variety of food at Heaven Star is wide and compares to other authentic Chinese\
    \ restaurants. I especially like the ones that say “Heaven Star Special XXXX”\
    \ such as the Heaven Star Special Beef Stew (or something to that effect). I don’t\
    \ think you can go wrong choosing any of these “specials”. Don’t order the Yang\
    \ Chao Fried Rice (the most common fried rice), instead go the Chicken and Salted\
    \ Fish fried rice or some other as those have way better flavor. I will never\
    \ go back to Yang Chao. \nI’m a creature of habit so I tend to stick with my favorites.\
    \ Wanting to break this habit, I asked the waitress (the waiters speak English\
    \ - the auxiliary servers for water and stuff don’t) for her recommendations.\
    \ She was spot on and we’ve always asked for and ordered their recommendations\
    \ since. I had a negative experience once when I ordered the Dim Sum sampler for\
    \ dinner time, which came out kinda dry. I ate most of it anyway. When the waitress\
    \ asked if everything was okay, I told her about it. She apologized and promptly\
    \ ordered a new batch cooked. The servers at Heaven Star have so far been friendly\
    \ to me and my wife. In most authentic Chinese restaurants, I don’t expect everybody\
    \ to speak English so I don’t get disappointed when they don’t. I do, however,\
    \ expect the person taking my order to speak English. \nAs for the price, I would\
    \ say it is reasonable given the food, place (yes, it’s clean all around and has\
    \ really nice restrooms), and the service. We always end up leaving nice tips.\
    \ But that’s just us, you’re mileage may vary. \nTodd, it would be really interesting\
    \ if you could visit it again and write a review. Thanks!\nPS: 2 weeks ago, our\
    \ server suggested (the younger chubby one) recommended us to have their lobster,\
    \ which was on a buy 1 get the other 1 free promo for 19.99. She suggested that\
    \ we had it cooked with ginger and scallions. Boy, that was Excellent! It had\
    \ great flavors at a great price! I initially thought that the lobsters would\
    \ be small but I was wrong. We even had left overs. That promotion may be over\
    \ now but boy… that was good when it lasted. \nThanks for the blog, Todd. I’m\
    \ glad somebody is paying attention to our neck of the woods. I’ll definitely\
    \ try the other places you reviewed."

  text: "In response to Isaac’s suggestion to visit again and write a review…\nI’ve\
    \ actually been back to Heaven Star several times since I wrote this original\
    \ review.  I haven’t visited again for supper, but have been there for dim sum\
    \ lunch probably 6 or 8 times now.  \nI’ve had better service lately.  I think\
    \ the staff got over their initial learning curve, which is nice.  I’ve also found\
    \ that if you want something that the dim sum carts haven’t been pre-loaded with,\
    \ you just have to ask and they’ll be glad to go make some for you.  \nFor example,\
    \ they have turnip cakes on the grill cart all the time, but I’m often in the\
    \ mood for taro cakes instead.  When I mentioned that to the lady, she went back\
    \ and had the kitchen make some for me.  About 15 minutes later, the taro cakes\
    \ arrived.\nThe only negative thing I have to say about Heaven Star is that they\
    \ still haven’t done any landscaping.  So the area in front of the restaurant\
    \ is still just a bunch of dirt, rocks, and chunks of broken concrete.  It seems\
    \ like by now they’ve had plenty of time to put in some plants or grass or something."

  text: 'I was also very excited that there would be an authentic Chinese and Dim
    Sum place to go to that is only 3 miles away from home.  I have been there about
    10 times (1 dinner, 9 lunch) since they have opened.  Also want to mention that
    I am American-Chinese and grew up in Hawaii with tons of authentic Chinese restaurants.  In
    my honest opinion Heavan Star has done really well with the renovations but I
    am not excited about their dim sum.  They don’t have quite the variety, flavor,
    and a little too greasy.  I would also mention that the prices add up to be quite
    expensive for lunch compared to the Denver dim sum places.

    I do have a suggestion for you to try.  Although it is not in Broomfield, I think
    Star Kitchen on Federal and Mississippi has the best Dim Sum in the Metro Denver
    area for now.  I have heard that the Chef from Super Star left them to open up
    Star Kitchen.  Since I have found Star Kitchen, I have only been back to Heaven
    Star once and regreted that I did not just drive 20 more mins.'

    text: I disagree about the prices comment from Jessica.  They recently lowered
      their prices, and we spend less money whenever we go out for dim sum at Heaven
      Star than when we go to any other dim sum restaurant in the area.  However,
      I haven’t tried Star Kitchen yet.  Having a decent dim sum place right in my
      suburb is just too convenient for me to want to drive 20 to 30 minutes each
      way just for lunch.

    serve with the promotion of a possible genocide of a species. ban this restaurant
    from your lists of places to eat until they remove dishes like this.
