      how you look at it, I’m sure there are plenty.  The USARS rules are fallow ground
      for this right now.

    text: Regarding video, supposedly Justin.tv keeps videos archived for 4 days after
      a broadcast.  But I went back the day after and couldn’t find it.  I think they
      already deleted it, which really sucks.  I did save the raw footage from my
      camera, which includes the announcer audio. A couple players asked for DVDs,
      but it’s enough work to turn the raw footage into DVDs that I’m only going to
      do it if there’s enough interest.  If you are interested in buying a set of
      4 DVDs, drop me an email.

  text: The Eastern Iowa Outlaws are willing to put up 1/3 of the cost for the video
    footage-$100.00.  If Tulsa and Rushmore would like to match- we should be able
    to get this done.  We can’t thank you enough for your time and expertise Todd.
    It will definitely be interesting to see who decides to play by or atleast try
    this rule set.
