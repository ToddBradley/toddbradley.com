    is always better a little later on the calendar.

    I would live to know how to make the delicious pork red sauce that is served with
    the Chiles Rellenos from Dos Hombres in Grand Junction!'

    text: Hi, Jennifer. There’s only one Dos Hombres left. Did you know that? The
      Redlands location that you probably remember from our youth closed a couple
      years ago. The one remaining location is in Clifton. I looked at their menu,
      and they don’t even list chiles rellenos as a separate menu item. They’re only
      there as a side dish with some other things. So I looked over the “Chili Choices”
      section of their menu (https://go2dos.com/menu-clifton.html) to see if I could
      figure out the “delicious pork red sauce” you’re talking about. The most likely
      candidate is the “Dos Hombres Green Chili”. If that’s the one you’re thinking
      of, it sounds just like my Great Uncle Gale’s green chile recipe that I learned
      before he died. I could teach you how to make it, if you want.
