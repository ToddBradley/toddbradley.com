    I bought was supposed to come with the stock 2 GB of RAM, according to the relevant
    web page on Apple’s site:

    http://store.apple.com/us/product/FB513LL/A#overview

    I wanted 4 GB of RAM, so I ordered 2 2 GB RAM chips from iFixIt.com.  When the
    new laptop arrived, before I even turned it on, I swapped out the RAM with the
    new ones I bought.

    However, now I’m looking at the RAM chips that were in it before and I see they’re
    both 2 GB chips.  So I paid for 2 GB of RAM in the MBP, but they sent it loaded
    with 4 GB, which I promptly replaced with a different 4 GB.  Strange.  I guess
    I need to sell the spares on eBay or something…'
