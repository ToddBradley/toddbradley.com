  text: Todd, it is truly a strange world now. Even in our tiny town, with a large
    population of elderly people, it has been quieter than usual. When Desantis, our
    governor lifted restrictions on parks, there were more boats and people on jetskis
    than I’ve ever seen. Walmart continues to be busy, but we don’t go there. Now,
    on Monday, more restrictions are being lifted, and Florida continues to have more
    cases. 900 new cases in one day in the state. I don’t think we will be going out
    for quite a while. I found your post very interesting., and I look forward to
    hearing about the consequences of covid19 in your world.
