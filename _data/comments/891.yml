    I HAVE HAD 4 SURGERIES ON MY RIGHT EAR AND 2 ON MY LEFT EAR. I DEVELOPED A FUNGAL  INFECTION
    IN THE LEFT EAR AND AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO LEVAQUIN LEFT ME WITH TENDENITIS,
    THEN A STAPH INFECTION. I HAD MY TUBES REMOVED ON 12/18/08. I TOOK OFF WORK A
    MONTH AND HAVE BEEN BACK 2 WEEKS. I STILL HAVE SEVERE HEADACHES AND THE AUTOPHONY
    IS STILL IN BOTH EARS. I AM PLEASED YOU HAVE HAD SOME GOOD SUCCESS WITH YOUR PROBLEN.
    I ALSO HAD A BLEED BEHIND MY RIGHT EYE DUE TO PRESSURE. I GO BACK FOR A CHECK
    UP ON APRIL 22,2009, I DON’T WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOOD LUCK.I
    HAVE BEEN GOING TO SHEA CLINIC IN MEMPHIS KNOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD. MY SYMPTOMS
    STARTED IN 2007. MY VOICE IS A WHISPER AND HEARING MYUSELF CHEW AND MY HEART BEATING

  text: 'Hi, Angie.  Fortunately, I never had serious problems with vertigo.  At the
    worst, it was very mild compared to what most people with SCDS have.

    My CSF pressure is still inexplicably high.  We tried to figure out why, but didn’t
    succeed.  Right now I’m just continuing to take 1 Diamox each day.  I’ve noticed
    that the autophony symptoms in my left (unoperated) ear go away after I take a
    Diamox.'
