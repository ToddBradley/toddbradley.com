    text: Thanks. It was a bit of a disappointing birthday this year due to the virus.
      But at least I finally got my gift, a week later.

  text: Happy Happy!  That’s the kind of notebook that screams out for a good fountain
    pen!  But Beware!  There are a never ending variety to choose from, all a little
    more expensive than you want them to be!  And then there are the inks!  Oh the
    inks!  There are more inks than there are pens each more attractive than the last,
    you think there are a lot of paint swatches at a good hardware store, that doesn’t
    have anything on fountain pen ink.  Fountain pens may also be the last bastion
    of the true nerd who has to struggle through their anti-social tendencies to talk
    about their pens on YouTube.  I know this because I just received my Lamy Studio
    in brushed stainless steel with a Fine steel nib, I have it inked up with Iroshizuku
    Ama-Iro ink, and even though I’ve written less than a page with this pen I’m already
    planning what my next pen is going to be!

  text: That is very cool.  I love journals like that, especially when the pages are
    blank- but papyrus with that cover? I love it!
