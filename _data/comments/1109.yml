  text: 'The Wednesday night restaurant on the radio mentioned this restaurant very
    favorably.  The location is good for my husband and I and so we tried it..

    What a great surprise..We had the dinner for 2 which gives one a taste (large
    taste_) of a number of their dishes..Everything was wonderful..I do agree with
    the above writer that I would have liked butter with my bread, but everything
    else was very good.  It was a new dining experience for us but we will definately
    go back.

    The atomsphere is contempory with candlelight at dinner but not a formal or stuffy
    feeling..Just right.  Value was excellent, but the best part was the food.  Even
    if one is not used to Polish fare-great food is great food.  I have already recommended
    this restaurant to several people.  One should try it if you are looking for a
    charming atomsphere and excellent dining experience.'

    body, but tastier than butter.

    text: Yeah, my boss, who’s from Poland, filled me in afterward.  I didn’t really
      find it all that tasty, myself, but maybe I didn’t slather it on in sufficient
      quantities.  I only put on about how much butter I’d normally use.

  text: I think they need to move their sides around to match their meals they have
    a noodle with cabbage meal and their side is a sweet cabbage. Ok when you have
    noodles with cabble lets service it with something else like the beetroot salad.
    Also offer a meat with it for a bit more price. As that would of been good paired
    with their Keilbasa. I was raise with a German grandma and polish adopted aunt
    and they both cooked almost everything on this menu and i never seen the paring
    on the table at home. You are totally right that they are trying to omit the butter
    and I thought it was just me that my food was a bit cold when I went in there
    for lunch twice. Took my husband  in there for dinner, he was no impressed too
    much.and we live half a block away,. I love it as it was grams cooking. I cook
    a lot it but, its nice to go have someone else cook it for you at times. I died
    and went to heave when it opened and I tried it the first week it opened. The
    one noodle thing I ordered said they were homemade noodles cut in triangles and
    these noodles were clearly not homemade as they were curly edges and I know my
    homemade noodles as thats all we eat around here as if grams wasn’t making them
    I go buy them from the church ladies.  Steps down off my soap box now. But, really
    go give this place a try. I will go back as its really yummy all in all.      the
    beet soup is yummy the pork chop is yummy, the noodles with cabbage is yummy and
    the keilbasa is to die for. I cant remember names right now as its so early and
    going to go get a keilbasa sammich today as now im hungry for one. hehe. bye.

  text: I love, love, love the pork fat that comes with bread. Think of it as “prosciutto
    bianco”—that’s how Italian restaurants get around the horror that, stateside,
    generally accompanies the word “lardo.”

  text: I would like to recommend the “bigos” its really quite good. I’m originally
    from Poland but grew up here in the states (Buffalo). I took my GF to this place
    as we lived in Broomfield. I was talking to my mom about my craving for her bigos
    and couldn’t wait for her to mail me hers(shes still in Buffalo) so i googled
    “Polish food”, anyway i was impressed with my bigos and have come back for more
    since then. Next time your there give it a try.

  text: '5 stars for Cracovia Restaurant! My husband and I went there out of curiosity
    for dinner, and had a wonderful meal. We ordered the platter for 2, which is a
    generous two-portion meal that serves a combination of all their yummy food. I
    would recommend this to anyone, for a date night, and even for lunch. It’s reasonably
    priced and really, really great food all cooked by the owners themselves.
