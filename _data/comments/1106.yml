  text: Last I drove by Main and 120th, they were still working on the new restaurant.  Man,
    these folks aren’t quick.  I remember how Broomfield’s Burger King went from bare
    ground to fully up in 3 days, and it’s taken Heaven Star 4 months to just remodel
    one restaurant into a new restaurant.

    text: I didn’t mean that Heaven Star is going to look like a Burger King, just
      that it took them forever to remodel the place.  However, I’ve now been there
      twice already even though they’ve only been open a week - once for “regular”
      Chinese food from the menu and one for dim sum.  I just haven’t have time yet
      to write up a review.

  text: I drove by and talked to the owners last week.  They expect to open on January
    8th.  I can’t wait.  They also said that the Heaven Star on Alameda isn’t going
    anywhere.  This is an additional restaurant.

  text: I heard 3rd hand that Heaven Star just opened today.  I’m out of town in Louisiana,
    but when I get back to Broomfield later this week, I’ll check it out for myself.

  text: 'Awesome, I have been driving by this place every day, glad to hear it (might)
    finally be open.

    I noticed they put up a sign that says something about “grand opening” but it
    is high up and on a part of the restaurant that isn’t close to the road, so I
    haven’t been able to catch if it is actually open or not. I noticed they put up
    some red flags around, so I assume if they are not open, they will be very soon.

    I’ll give them a try this weekend.'

  text: Burger King? I have yet to visit Heaven Star but I doubt the decor is going
    to resemble anything remotely similar to a Burger King. Let’s not compare apples
    to oranges here. My wife and I are taking my parents there tonight for their anniverssary
    dinner and I will post back later with my review.

  text: Just went there last week.  The food was great.  The service was not so good.  Will
    give them some credit since they just opened.
