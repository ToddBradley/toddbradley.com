  text: I bought a new laptop less than a year ago, and bought it because the OS (PureOS)
    was focused on keeping out the bad stuff. When I first brought up the OS, it came
    only with a browser that extended FF, but after a recent update, they transitioned
    to solely FF, because of this and a few other changes (I didn’t dig, so I’m not
    sure exactly what they are).
