    discovered “urban bikes.” After some research, I elected to get this one (versus
    the 3.0) and will be taking delivery of it soon-ish.

    Now that you’ve had it about a month, I’m curious about your additional impressions…
    all the reviews I’ve read of this bike are fairly early in the person’s time with
    the bike.

    Thanks.

    (I’m transitioning to this bike from an aluminum mountain bike with front shocks,
    btw, in preparation for also losing enough weight to return to my somewhat-harsh
    aluminum road bike.)'
