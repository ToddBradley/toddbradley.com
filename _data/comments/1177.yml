  text: It is a bit depressing, but I’m looking forward to traveling less for a while
    and having time to finally work on my photography business. And I hope you will
    have time to finish the videos that have fallen to the wayside while we travel.
    Thanks for being willing to try my crazy idea of traveling around and working.
    I will never regret it.

    you guys had a tough year.

  text: You’ve done what the majority of humans fail to do, and that is to move out
    of your comfort zone and live differently for a while. Perhaps everything that
    you’ve dreamed of has not worked out the way you had hoped. I’m grateful that
    you’ve been able to have the experiences that you have had and I’m sad that your
    collective dreams will be put on hold. I think that is all part of the journey
    and there’s no doubt in my mind that you will create new dreams and new experiences
    and show the world that you’re not down and out. You’re just taking a different
    road right now. Love you guys. I wish you all the best.
