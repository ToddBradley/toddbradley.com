  text: I too blame the city council. What’s going to become of K-Mart when the mega
    store whose name I cannot type opens next to it and drives it out of business?
    Another empty strip mall. The one at 120th & Greenway sat empty for years when
    the Albertsons left there and moved down the road to 120th & Sheridan (Westminster).
    The current owner, Pacific Ocean Market had to do substantial rehab to that building.
    We don’t have a Super Target either. Why? There’s a plan for 120th. I’m just not
    sure it’s been visited since 1950.
