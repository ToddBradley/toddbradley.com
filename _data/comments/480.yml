  text: Todd we also visited the alligator farm last January when Rick and I made
    that journey.  About the most exciting part of the trip for that area!  And we
    also ate at Fawn’s.  It was for that reason that we cancelled our motel reservations
    in Alamosa and chose to stay in South Park!

  text: Wow, I’m sorry you also went to Fawn’s.  Alamosa does have other interesting
    stuff to do around it in the valley - Valley View Hot Springs, Joyful Journey
    Hot Springs, the alligator farm, Zapata Falls, the Monte Vista wildlife refuge
    where the sandhill cranes come in droves every year, Alamosa wildlife refuge where
    there are about a dozen bald eagles (that we’ve seen), and so on.  But it’s no
    center of culture, that’s for sure.
