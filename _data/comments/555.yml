    to think up “recipes” while watching!  I think this recipe would go great with
    my pheasant skewer recipe!  Does the pineapple and soy sauce make this tangy?  Tangy
    or sweet is kind of needed with the jalepenos’

  text: It’s not very tangy.  The pineapple - since it’s used very sparingly - just
    gives a very occasional bit of sweet and sour.  And there aren’t any jalapenos
    in it, at least not any fresh ones.  What I was going to put in - but didn’t -
    are canned chiles.  Those are very, very mild.
