    year, but we decided to be brave and sign up for the full share.  It was a wonderful
    experience, and I’ve written some about it on our blog, butterwhat.blogspot.com

    I hope you have as great of an experience as we did!

  text: Thanks for the pointer to your blog, Lisa.  Your recipes are making me hungry!  I’d
    encourage you to keep posting to it, even more often next season.  Maybe I’ll
    do the same.  We got our official CSA member certificate from New Moon Farms CSA
    last week, but we won’t see any food from it for another several months.  My biggest
    concern is that we’ll get more veggies than we can deal with and we’ll run out
    of freezer space to store them over the winter.
