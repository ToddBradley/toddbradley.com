    ghost dog: way of the samurai

    forest whitaker plays ghost dog, he’s the main character.  he has a good buddy
    who only speaks french.  they don’t understand each other, however we understand
    them as we have the power of subtitles on our side.

    a nicely wrought film with a slow and steady pace.

    i’ve never been to casa bonita either….  sounds like a great one to bring the
    kids too as well

    🙂'

    for the Japanese, so you gotta get all of Mifune through his acting (unless you
    understand Japanese, of course).

    What a coincidence that you commented on this, when I just watched another Lee
    Marvin anti-war movie last night, “The Dirty Dozen.”'
