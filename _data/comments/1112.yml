  text: It’s quite a strange coincidence that sisters “Jenny” and “Susan” both have
    the same writing style.  For instance, they both consistently omit the space after
    the period at the end of a sentence.  They also posted both these comments from
    the same computer, only two minutes apart.  Aren’t sisters great?

  text: 'Beth and I tried the dinner buffet Friday night, and we weren’t impressed.  It
    seems like the same food as for lunch.  In fact, it may have been actually the
    same food as for lunch!  Some of the things had been sitting out for way too long.

    Since they charge a few dollars more for the dinner buffet, I was hoping to find
    that they’d offer items that the lunch buffet doesn’t have.  But that wasn’t the
    case.  Next time we’ll just order from the menu.'

  text: 'My wife and I ate there this Sunday (12/27/2009) and the buffet table was
    pretty empty and lacking.

    The worst came when we were at the table and a baby cockroach came crawling down
    the wall, we decided to overlook it. 5 minutes later the BIG MOMMA cockroach came
    crawling down the wall, we dropped the forks, jumped up, paid and left.

    I will be filing a complaint with the Board of Health this morning.

    AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!'

  text: There are better restaurants in Denver than this place. The food is spiceless,
    not authentic and the service is strictly okay. They should think about closing
    down this place as there is nothing exciting on the menu or in the buffet. I don’t
    think they have been very successful in pulling the crowd either. Would not return
    or recommend this place to others. Go to yak and yeti or Jewel of india. They
    are sooo much better.
