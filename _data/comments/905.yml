  text: So Todd - we are considering getting rid of cable. Did you go with a satellite
    provider?  If so, which one and do you like it better than traditional HD cable?  We
    only have the choice of Bresnan here in GJ, it friggin’ outrageously expensive!  Just
    getting other peoples’ opinions before we make a final decision.

  text: We have digital cable.  I didn’t go with satellite because we needed digital
    cable anyhow for our internet service.  We could switch to cable for our phone
    service, too.  It would save a few bucks a month, but Beth has been reluctant
    to do that.  But now that we both have expensive cell phones, we’ve talked about
    cutting off our land line altogether.  And with the rise of Skype and now Google,
    we need a phone line even less.
