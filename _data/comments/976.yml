    blog, or its companion blog on minimalism?

    it began to seem like more clutter-oh no, another thing I have to do, simplify
    my life!

    I did keep 2 albums, because 1 is signed by an old boyfriend and another was given
    to me by my brother. I don’t know if the other ones even played. I hope this stuff
    doesn’t end up in the landfill. I hope people get good use out of what they took
    home.

    There was a lot of gardening stuff I hauled out late that people would have taken
    if I had put it out there early. Now the shelves in our garage look sort of empty.'
