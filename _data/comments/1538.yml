  text: LaCie Little Big Disk 1tb I own one I think it is one of the original and
    it worked great for a couple of years I then on retirement put it away went to
    use it and nothing so I have looked all over the web and your article gives me
    some hope?I have a small MacBook air as I used windows pc on retirement but my
    daughter gave me her old one and I thought it was good opportunity to see if I
    could do anything with Lacie I think i purchased mine circa 2014 ish It is not
    even recognised by disk utility and also it shows good blue light on connection
    I tried installing the driver and lace app but no luck so my only option is to
    dismantle and mount them and test sort of similar to your idea to see what is
    the issue as I hear discs working and turning on connection to mac so I wandered
    how to get past the casing ?? Do you know of any youtube videos to break past
    casing as it has all these steel ribs ?
