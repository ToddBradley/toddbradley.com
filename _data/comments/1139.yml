    Saw your post shared on Facebook and wanted to let you know we’ve had a lot of
    success finding long term house-sits through http://www.trustedhousesitters.com
    and http://www.housecarers.com. I’m sure there are a few others out there as well
    that may be more specific to the US. Best of luck with your search! We hope for
    the best for Beth and both of your ongoing travels.

    Take care!

    Lisa & Cheryl'

    text: Thanks for the suggestion, Lisa and Cheryl.  We were on housecarers.com
      for several months last year, and found absolutely nothing useful.  But I just
      signed up for TrustedHousesitters.com and hopefully we’ll have better luck there.
