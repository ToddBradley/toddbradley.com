  text: 'I feel for you Todd…. Just when you thought you were free! I’m going through
    a bit of a depression too with my severed nerve pinky preventing me from playing
    guitar. And I had big plans to be a traveling musician until my band just dissolved
    and I was left looking for work like everyone else I was trying to NOT be like.
    But think of it not as a defeat, but as a preparation you didn’t plan for. You’ll
    still do the dream man. I’ll still do my dream, though an amended dream that better
    suites who I am.

    We’ve had the shortest day of the year already, so it’s only getting warmer from
    here! Hang in there buddy!'

      ourselves from slipping back into our “old life”.

  text: Thanks for being honest Todd. It’s crazy how an innocent comment can cut to
    a feeling you didn’t even know existed.  You two seem strong and determined. Thanks
    also for including us in your journey. I think of Beth often.

  text: 'I felt so sad when I read this post. I knew some of it, of course, but I
    didn’t understand the extent.

    I remember back in Seattle, our second city, I would get into a similar mood.
    I would think, “Here I am sitting in an apartment (instead of my office) editing
    (just like the old days). How has anything changed? I’m in a new city, but my
    life seems so much the same.”

    It’s not just the location that needs to change, but also the goals themselves.'

      of 2011, or now?
