  text: You solved a mystery for me.  When Linda and I were young, our Dad would always
    stop at the geyser on our trips to Idaho.  Linda and I looked forward to the stop
    because it seemed like a heck of a long drive across there.  I always wondered
    what happened to the geyser since there isn’t any signs pointing the travellers  to
    it.

  text: Thanks, Todd, for the travel log.  Wondering why someone would name their
    motel, Tamarisk?  A useless water-hogging invasive plant.  I’ve even heard that
    no bird species nest in it.

    text: Yeah, there’s nothing fun about tamarisk, but it’s a fact of life and it’s
      still all over. I wish we could go back in time and teach those people 130 or
      140 years ago the future problems of introducing invasive species. As far as
      using the name goes, the Tamarisk Restaurant has been in business since 1979,
      so Utahns may have had a different perspective on the name 40 years ago. The
      name of the little “motel” (the three rooms for rent underneath the restaurant)
      is the Skyfall Guestrooms.

  text: Your mom and I went to the geyser with our parents a couple of times in the
    late 50’s early 60’s. It went about 30 feet into the air. There was a rock museum
    with beautiful geodes and other rocks which impressed me. They also had a souvenir
    shop and cafe. I remember the cokes were ice cold, which was needed in the hot
    desert and no air conditioning. I’ve often wondered what happened to this site.
    Thanks for the update.

      it in town?
