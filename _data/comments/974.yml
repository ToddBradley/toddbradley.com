  text: 'Hi there Todd,

    I think I’ve met you on the SCDS forums, but just wanted to stop by and say “hi”
    from a fellow SCDS surgical repair person.  I am now about 3 weeks post op.  I
    feel really blessed that we had expertise here locally so that I did not have
    to travel across the country like you did.  I live in Seattle and my doc is Dick
    Hoistad, MD and he said he is friends with Dr. G and he has also trained with
    Dr. Timothy Hain in Chicago.

    Chris'

  text: Hi, Chris.  I hope you’re recovering well from your surgery.  Thought it wasn’t
    ideal, I really didn’t mind traveling to Louisiana to get worked on by Dr. Gianoli.  He’s
    so awesome that it was worth the extra effort and expense.
