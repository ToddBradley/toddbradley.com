  text: Good summary, thanks.  Having traveled a little, most of your points are spot
    on.  I would disagree with you on not taking a camera - maybe not a video camera
    but I think the still camera photos added a lot to your capture and memory of
    what you did and saw.  The point about staying in one location for a good length
    of time is good.  We’re stayed a month at a time in Florida, Arizona, and Costa
    Rica.  These worked out well since we had a car at each and enuf to do and see
    to fill the month plus relax and hike.  We also did Costa Rica and Panama for
    a month where we stayed 4 locations - did take extra funds for transportation
    and more pack/unpack time.  But I can see based on where you went that trying
    to cover that much ground in a few months means lots of air and other travel fare
    - and takes up valuable time.

  text: When I mentioned I disagreed with your suggestion that a camera was not needed,
    I forgot you had another camera - on your phone.  But saw your writeup on another
    blog about fact you didn’t use your big camera much in the end but instead used
    the iphone, thought I best withdraw my earlier comment.
