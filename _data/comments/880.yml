  text: 'Well Todd, I will take a shot at it.  I am keeping in mind that in the south-
    prices may be different than in the north and so I am shaving a smidge cost off
    due to that but not must cause your doc is very specialized and this must be a
    well known teaching hospital.  Lots of guessing going on here.

    These are guesses-

    operating room charges as follows

    opertating supplies-$2,700

    crani-$6,900

    microscope use-$1,400

    microscope supplies-$235

    anesthesia drugs-$2,000

    anesthsia supplies-$350

    respiratory-$550

    SEP’s-evoked potentials-$1,500

    recovery-$1,300

    drugs during surgery-$1,700

    monitor use during surgery-$500

    recovery-$1,200

    incidentials—-$900

    ————————-

    now for your room charges

    I will guess $1,250 a day for a private in ICU

    I think you were there 3 days right? so-

    $3,750 but I am not sure if you left ICU and moved to a step down unit which would
    be cheaper.  Let me know on that one.

    Drugs in room-$1,100

    —————————

    now for the actual doctor charges

    crani-$5,000

    SEP’s-one for each day you were there I would guess but they only charged for
    one-so $250

    Anethesia MD-$2,000

    room visits were free from ENT but not nuero so

    nuero visit-$200

    —————————

    are we counting go home drugs?  if so I will go with around $750 that does not
    include OTC

    ——————————-

    now you did not mention if this included testing before or after surgery so I
    did not add that in

    ——————————-

    for good measure I will throw in a incidentals charge of oh let’s say-$6,000 because
    you had CSF biz and there are other things I am sure I can’t think of.

    ————————————

    how am I doing so far?  Anywhere close?  I think this brought it to about $40,000.

    I will be anxious to know how far off I really am. 🙂  Let me know Todd.  Hope
    all is  going well.'

    \nLet me give you a few clues to help you refine your estimates.  \nFirst, I was\

    \ a university.  It’s just the regular hospital for the area around Hammond, Louisiana.\n\
    Just for grins, let’s include the cost of any pre-op tests up to one week before\
    \ surgery, whether they were done at the surgeon’s office or at the hospital or\
    \ elsewhere.  Also, we’ll include the costs of all the medicines I had to take\
    \ after surgery; that includes meds in the hospital and after I got home (which\
    \ in my case was a hotel room for a week and then my real home).  And yes, we’ll\
    \ include the costs of dealing with my CSF pressure and anything else ordered\
    \ by my surgeon within one month of the surgery.\nI’m still waiting to see if\
    \ others want to play.  If we don’t have at least 3 players, I won’t bother to\

    No, I don’t need to add up the “every day” price of everything for insurance.  I’ll
    only add up the actual prices I paid (which will be much lower in nearly every
    case), both for insurance reasons and for tax reasons.'

    then we’re on.  Otherwise, I don’t think it’s worth it to do all the math.  But
    I think your guesses are probably in the right ballpark!

  text: I am having the surgery done this Wednesday, December 7th, and was told about
    your site form a referral patient my surgeon gave me.  I have been curious about
    the priceand since I have had a knee, shoulder and kneck surgery in the past 4
    years, I am guessing this will be quite a bit more.  I am guessing $95,000 everything
    included.  Any tips or advice on my upcoming surgey would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks,

    text: 'Well, as far as tips and advice go, the absolute best place to get information
      about SCDS surgery is here: http://scdssupport.org.

      Regarding the cost, I honestly never calculated an exact cost, because it’s
      impossible.  Originally, when I asked this question, I was under the naive impression
      that a cost is a cost is a cost.  But then I learned the dirty not-so-secret
      of the health care industry, which is that there’s no single price for anything.  There’s
      the amount the service provider says the service costs, there’s the amount they
      actually bill the insurance company, there’s the amount the insurance company
      actually pays, and there’s the amount they would have charged you if you were
      paying in cash instead of using an insurance company.  Once I learned how variable
      prices are, I just gave up trying to compute the sum.  I think my insurance
      and I were billed about $70k, and I think we actually paid about $40k.'
