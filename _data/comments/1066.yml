  text: 'I downloaded “This Definitely Ends The Broadcast Day” from mp3.com back in
    1998… but lost all my files a few years later and have since spent the last 10
    years looking for it. It was the only song I couldn’t find of all the ones I really
    liked.

    I am so happy to have it back.

    Thank you very much for posting this!'

      to find it again after all these years.

  text: I made yet another update. I no longer own the domain name 404notfound.net.
    Someone else owns that now and is doing even dumber things with it than I was.
    But the 404 Not Found catalog is still all available for free online. So I updated
    the links in the post to point to the new places.
