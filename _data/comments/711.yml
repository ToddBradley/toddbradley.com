  text: 'My Drobo still hasn’t arrived.  Their website said it was backordered 5 days,
    which meant it should have been shipping over a week ago and gotten here in the
    middle of this week.  But it’s now Saturday, and no sign of the Drobo.

    I emailed the company to find out what’s up, and they wrote back saying that there
    has been very high demand for this product and that my order would be made a high
    priority.  It was supposed to ship yesterday.  But according to their website,
    it’s still on backorder.

    Order date: 07/11/2008

    Status: BACKORDERED

    Blech!

    Fortunately, they haven’t charged my credit card yet for the purchase.'

    for two weeks and I’m getting a little antsy.

    text: I don’t honestly remember how long it took.  But once I got it I was pretty
      happy with it.  So it’ll be worth the wait, I think.  Ironically, I’m not using
      mine at the moment because I’m on the road traveling for a year, and it’s not
      very portable.
