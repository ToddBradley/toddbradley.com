    My church is outting on a Christmas play and we have a VH-120 with headsets. Your
    right, it is not very good, but it is better than nothing. We would like the lavalier
    mics for the kids. Would you be interested in selling the mics? I really don’t
    want to pay retail and throw good money after bad. I need them by 12/14, so let
    me know. Thanks'
