  text: Hey Todd, sending good thoughts and prayers your way. I had a hysterectomy
    in Oct. And ended up staying in the hospital for 7 days due to complications.
    Your story and pictures bring back a lot of memories. Take care if yourself and
    give yourself more time than you think you need to recover! I guess we’re getting
    old when we’re talking about our surgeries!
