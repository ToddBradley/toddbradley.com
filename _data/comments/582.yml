    Now,” is in my opinion better than the earlier two.

  text: 'Iron Maiden’s first album was called “Iron Maiden” and while it has many
    of the musical elements that set the tone for the band for years to come, it’s
    very rough and raw sounding.  On their second album, “Killers”, they took the
    musical complexities that they hinted at on “Iron Maiden” and really emphasized
    them.  “Killers” has songs with several key elements that would set Iron Maiden
    apart from most 80’s metal bands - mixing up time signatures in a song, key changes,
    and instrumentals.  The complexity of their music really showed in “Killers” but
    the quality of the lyrics also came out, and they started to perform songs that
    had more intricate story lines.

    In the case of Van Halen, their first album “Van Halen” was also raw and very
    original.  It’s hard to beat the opening one-two-three punch of “Running with
    the Devil” and “Eruption” and “You Really Got Me.”  But their sophomore effort,
    “Van Halen II” was recorded and mixed better.  It also has an arguably wider variety
    of musical styles from poppy dance songs (“Dance the Night Away”) to classical
    acoustic guitar experiments (“Spanish Fly”) to drinking songs (“Bottom’s Up”)
    to love songs (“Women in Love”) to full throttle hard rock (“Light Up the Sky”).'
