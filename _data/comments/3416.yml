    of the Spanish pronunciation Cah-low-RAW-do (broad a as in Father).

    Another Austin one is the name for the drag at UT. The street is Guadalupe but
    it’s pronounced “Gwah-duh-LOOP”'

  text: 'The PNW has it’s own set of shibboleths.  Aloha (west of Portland) is accented
    like Ramona.  Portland has a street named Couch St that is pronounced as if it
    has 2 Os.  That was a confusing one, because I kept on hearing about “Cooch St”
    and seeing “Couch St” and I didn’t know for a while that they were the same street.

    And there’s a town in WA called “Puyallup”.'

  text: 'One that’s been lost to time (or so it seems) follows the pattern of Buena
    Vista: my grandmother (born in Trinchera in 1907) would say Pueblo as “PYOO-eb-lo”.

    Her given name was even Lucia, even though none of her children were aware of
    that until after she was dead.

    Go figure.'
