    Not only is the “west” pursuing a poorly considered policy against the perceived
    threat, the West is also ignoring a thousand years of history. Americans especially
    have very little concern for deep history. Those two huge oceans have granted
    us a measure of comparative safety unavailable to Europeans and Asians. High school
    kids today blow off remaining concerns about the Vietnam conflict… while Eastern
    Europe is still pissed about the Mongols and the Ottomans. Broken promises from
    WWI still rankle in the so called Middle East (what do you call it if you live
    in China, the Middle West?). That isn’t history;it’s current events. Yep, cut
    off the money and cut off US arms suppliers who are making and selling the stuff.'

  text: 'Todd, Good analogy, and you hit it on the head - take the food away, at least
    applicable to the coyotes; may not work in all cases for the terrorists.

    I feel comfortable with addressing your comments on the coyotes; maybe not so
    much on the terrorists - as they seem to pop up in many countries in small numbers
    so hard to isolate.

    On the coyotes, their abundancy correlates with abundance of their food.  In the
    desert regions of western CO and adjacent states, coyotes rely significantly on
    rabbit and mice populations, supplemented by the weak and dead deer/elk/antelope,
    etc.  And the population of the coyotes tends to go in cycle with the rabbit.  When
    the coyote population explodes, the rabbits get decimated, then the coyote population
    plunges, then rabbits multiply rapidly back up within a year or two - usually
    about a 5-7 year cycle.  But other factors are there as well.  If it’s a wet summer
    and vegetation grows more than normal, both rabbit and mice populations explode
    like summer of 2015.  In significant drought years, both species decline.  And
    the coyotes are currently doing very well.

    But coyotes have all sorts of food sources and habitats.  Last I heard, the city
    of Los Angeles has about the highest density of coyotes of anywhere - lots of
    garbage, mice, pets, etc.

    There are scenarios where killing the coyote can basically eradicate them in particular
    areas.  Their habitat and living areas have to be pretty accessible by human,
    such as on the great plains of CO,WY,KS, etc.  I’ve seen it happen in both the
    eastern CO plains and western CO mountains in the 50’s, 60’s - good fur prices
    and some bounties by the government - but to keep the population down requires
    constant attention annually.  Of course a lot of this was done by traps and poison,
    not just shooting.

    Regarding the terrorists, I agree with a lot of what you said.  However, with
    so many offshoot radical organizations or just radical individuals in so many
    countries, not sure how you take care of those few whose deaths fuel the fire
    for others.  And in some of the countries like Afghan. and Iraq where a few radicals
    have gone in and taken entire small to moderate towns and held them until ousted,
    not sure how backing off helps to de-fuel them.'

    text: 'Peter Van Buren’s article doesn’t propose “backing off”. He proposes that
      small scale issues (like taking over a single town) should be handled solely
      by the local people’s government, and America should stay out of it. Ultimately
      it’s a local problem, anyhow, so having America waste a bunch of money and THEN
      hand it over to the locals just postpones the inevitable, and wastes money in
      the process.

      As far as how to “take care of those few whose deaths fuel the fire”, you just
      don’t even address it. If the deaths were caused by an occupying force like
      America, then we have failed to withdraw completely, which this whole thing
      relies on. If the deaths were caused by some local criminals, then it’s the
      local society’s problem to deal with or not, as they see fit. Taking away access
      to money turns a group of organized well-armed terrorists into just some crazy
      guy down on the street corner with a knife.

      And back to the coyote thing, yeah you can keep the population down if you try
      really hard, but it takes constant attention annually, “attention” meaning time
      and money. If a society feels like it has time and money to throw away, you
      can keep doing that brute force method. But there are smarter approaches.'
