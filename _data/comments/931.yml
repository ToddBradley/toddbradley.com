  text: Oh, I see, the remark is in the comments. Would you care to enlighten those
    of us who are not well-versed in industrial music (or industrial music that’s
    not really industrial)?

  text: 'I think the Wikipedia article describes industrial music way better than
    I ever could:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_music

    Because of its emphasis on traditional melodic patterns and dance beats, I’d call
    the music of Nine Inch Nails “industrial-inspired techno-pop” or maybe “industrial-inspired
    rock”.

    Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin took the essence of American blues music and turned
    it into something new that appealed to a wider (largely white) audience.  Nowadays
    we call that “heavy metal”.  In the same way, Trent Reznor took a form of music
    with very little commercial appeal (industrial music) and made a new form of music
    with popular marketability.

    So, “real” industrial music (such as Throbbing Gristle or Nurse with Wound) is
    to Nine Inch Nails what Memphis Minnie is to Black Sabbath.'

  text: Hmm, I don’t know how much the early industrial music creators were inspired
    by Kraftwerk, so I guess I can’t answer that.  That’s a question for a real music
    historian.

  text: Yeah, I guess I’ve always thought of NIN as more techno than industrial.  But
    I don’t tend to label my music too much. I call Green Day and Rise Against punk
    (along with a whole lot of other people) but my car calls them pop. Maybe it just
    means “pop”ular.

  text: I was just checking out the Facebook page for 101.5 FM, aka “Denver’s Independent
    Alternative.”  On the requests page, someone posted, “Whatever you do, don’t play
    Green Day.”  They’re so overexposed and overproduced, I’d agree with your car
    that they’re “pop” music.
