      have to get my brain lifted up out of the brain cavity this time.

  text: 'Todd, Stumbling upon your blog has been fantastic for me. I’ve been dealing
    with symptoms for many many years and doctors have always told me I have tinnitus
    and there was nothing to be done but live with it. Last Summer however, symptoms
    got way worse and I began to get motion sick while in cars, and dizzy quite a
    bit. It all progressed very quickly and I was put on disability until they could
    get me figured out. Mainly this is because I work an hour and a half from work
    and have to drive through the mountains to get there because living closer to
    where I work is a huge health risk to anyone. Well, after about a million different
    tests, I have surgery next week. I’m absolutely terrified! Your blog posts have
    helped me a little bit though because it’s about the only real thing I can find
    written by a human on the internet about the trans-mastoid approach. Thank you!!!
    At this point would you say that you are fully recovered? About how long did it
    take? My doctor is supposedly the best in the area for this surgery, but even
    he has only done it 7 times. Yikes! I completely trust him, but hello, this is
    major surgery and I can’t help but freak out. I just want to get back to working
    out at the gym, driving myself to places I need to go, standing up without getting
    dizzy, and not hearing every movement my body makes. Thanks for being brave and
    putting all this info out there for others like you!

      the various SCDS repair procedures, and how people recover from them, you should
      sign up for http://scdssupport.org.

      To answer your questions, I would NOT say that I am fully recovered. You can
      see all my posts after surgery, here: http://toddbradley.com/?cat=6. I’m still
      having side-effects from the surgery itself that make my hearing actually worse
      than it was before surgery.'

  text: Hi Todd!! How are you doing with your recovery? I hope all is well and you
    are back to work! I also had surgeries w? Dr. G and am a huge believer in his
    expertise and surgery technique and experience w SCDS. Did you have skull base
    repair also…..? Did he find holes in your skull base? He did mine….and repaired
    them during the SCDS along w the oval and round repair thank God & Dr. G he could
    do it all in one and not 3 -4 different surgeries. I am on fb Susan Lopez Aragon
    if you have any questions. I will be flying to Covington on April 15 for an appt
    on April 16,2014. HOpe you and your wife arewell!

  text: Oh. BTW Todd I graduated from a Southern Colorado school and do not know of
    many others in the 4 corners that have SCDS . I would love to get a 4 corners
    meet up sometime. Rochelle is from AZ and I only know of another person from NM
    who has probably SCDS she is not diagnosed yet. Do you know of others from Utah
    NM or AZ or CO?

    text: 'Yes, I’ve run across 3 or 4 SCDS sufferers from Colorado, 1 or 2 from Utah,
      1 from Arizona, but I can’t think of anyone from New Mexico. The best way to
      organize a 4 Corners meetup is to post something on the “Getting Together/Meetings”
      forum on the SCDSsupport.org site. It’s right here: http://scdssupport.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=20'
