    the Broomfield Enterprise:

    “An 18-year-old driver Monday hit three cars and a road sign before careening
    into the Bananelope coffee shop on Highway 287.”

    Oh no!  Someone’s trying to destroy the one remaining independent Broomfield coffee
    shop!'

  text: I realized that I misspelled the name of the cafe when I first wrote this
    review.  It’s “Bananelope” not “Bananalope”.  I guess that might explain why I
    couldn’t find a website about it, or a listing on Google Maps.  Turns out their
    website is http://www.bananelopecoffee.com.
